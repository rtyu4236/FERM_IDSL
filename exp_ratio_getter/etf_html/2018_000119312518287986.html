<div>The iShares iBonds Dec 2021 Term Muni Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of investment-grade U.S. municipal bonds maturing after December 31, 2020 and before December 2, 2021.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

then sell all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 0% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2021 Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of
investment-grade (as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)), non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing in 2021. As of October 31, 2017, there were 9,619 issues in the Underlying
Index.</div> <div>The Underlying Index includes municipal bonds
primarily from issuers that are state or local governments or agencies such that the interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). Each bond must have a rating of at least
BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”), or BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. To
remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each rebalancing date. All bonds in the</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index will mature after December 31, 2020 and before December 2,
2021. Bonds that mature or are pre-refunded in their respective year of maturity do not accrue interest past the maturity or pre-refund date. All payments related to the maturity or pre-refunding of a bond are reinvested in tax-exempt cash or cash
equivalents for the duration of each month.</div> <div>The Fund is a
series of the iShares iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series of bond exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) sponsored by BlackRock, Inc.
(“BlackRock”). The iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series do not invest in U.S. savings bonds or other U.S. government bonds and are not designed
to provide protection against inflation.</div> <div>BFA uses a
“passive” or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions
when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may
eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance
by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The
securities</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics
(based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying
index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including
shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to
time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund will generally hold municipal bond securities issued
by state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income,” including dividends, interest and capital
gains. In the last months of operation,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in
bonds but instead will be held in cash and cash equivalents, including, without limitation, shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and municipal commercial
paper. These cash equivalents may not be included in the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2021, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate, and its
net assets will be distributed to then-current shareholders. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any
industry.</div> <div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of this prospectus (“the Prospectus”)), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, or asset class.</div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial
condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cyber
Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>

<div>generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower
than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that
vary over time. It is expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity. Unlike a direct
investment in municipal bonds, the breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the Fund's existence it may make distributions at a greater
(or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which will result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely
affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis,
you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature or are near
maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and
may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, increases the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund invests in municipal bonds of issuers that are primarily state or local
governments or agencies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk<font>.</font><font> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to purchase or sell. This can reduce the Fund's returns because the Fund may
be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. The Fund invests a significant portion of its portfolio in municipal securities, which may be less liquid than comparable taxable bonds.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political or economic changes as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to
taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively
affected by the inability to collect revenues from the project or the assets. In the event of a default or insolvency, certain issuers of municipal bonds may be subject to proceedings other than those specified by U.S. bankruptcy</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>laws, which may impact the Fund’s ability to ultimately recover
assets.</div> <div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service
providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address
every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United States<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities
to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Securities Lending
Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a
timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger
adverse tax consequences for the Fund. Substitute payments received by the Fund with respect to municipal</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

income.”</font></div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> Tracking error is the divergence of a fund’s performance from that of the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in the applicable underlying index, pricing differences, differences in transaction costs, the fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in
timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to the fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market
volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while the applicable underlying index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets
that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or assets in the
Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div> </div> <div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund will wind up and terminate on or about December 1,
2021. Upon its termination, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In the final months of the
Fund's operations, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and
municipal commercial paper. By December 2, 2021, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in this manner. As the Fund approaches its termination date, its holdings of money market or similar funds may increase, causing the
Fund to incur the fees and expenses associated with investing in these funds. In accordance with the Trust's current Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Fund will terminate on or about the date noted above as approved by a
majority of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) without requiring additional approval by Fund shareholders. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board determines the extension to be in the best interest
of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of
the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences
between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time
to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance
on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated
to reflect such change or adjustment.</div> <div>“Tracking
error” is the divergence of the performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling
indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in its underlying
index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under new continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's
listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not
comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to
rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets. This may cause the Fund to underperform other
investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk. <font>The Fund may be more susceptible to an increased risk of loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of issuers in a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may be
subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences than the market as a whole.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk.<font> Credit risk is the
risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal payments when due or
otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or
counterparty’s credit rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share
price.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents
can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber attacks may also be carried out in
a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network
services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians,
transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially
resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the
inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In
addition, cyber attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans
and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service
providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During
the eleven months prior to the Fund's planned termination date, the bonds held by the Fund will mature and the Fund’s portfolio will convert to cash or cash equivalents. During these final eleven months, the Fund’s yield will generally
tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</font></div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk. <font>The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over time. It is expected that an investment in the
Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity to those held by the Fund, but unlike a direct investment in municipal bonds, the
breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment. The Fund may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio,
which will result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The breakdown between Fund distribution payments and the amount of liquidation proceeds may adversely affect the tax
characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may
experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. In addition, the yield on your investment (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the return on your purchase price) may be lower (or
higher) than the Fund's published yields, which are based on the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.<font> The Fund’s
income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, as bonds in its portfolio mature or are near maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted,</font></div>

<div>or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index
Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Therefore, gains, losses or costs associated with errors of the Index Provider or its agents will generally be
borne by the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other
constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> As interest
rates rise, the value of a fixed-income security held by the Fund is likely to decrease. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with
shorter durations. To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer-term durations, which is expected to occur to a greater degree earlier in the life of the Fund, rising interest rates
may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline significantly. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. In
addition, decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed-income markets.</div>
<div>The historically low interest rate environment was created in
part by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero percent. The Fed recently raised its benchmark
interest rate several times as the U.S. labor market strengthened and economic activity accelerated. The Fed indicated that it expects its accommodative monetary policy stance to support strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to
target inflation, which increases the likelihood of rising interest rates in the future. Fed policy going forward is less clear given recent changes in Fed leadership. Because the Fund holds a portfolio of securities set to mature at approximately
the same time, the Fund generally will have greater exposure to interest rate risk earlier in its life than closer to its termination date.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>Changes in the
financial condition of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect a security’s or
instrument’s credit quality or value. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk. <font>Liquidity risk
exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. To the extent the Fund invests in illiquid securities or securities that become less liquid, such investments may have a negative effect on the returns of the Fund because the
Fund may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed-income securities or the lack of an active market for such securities. Liquid investments may
become illiquid or less liquid, particularly during periods of market turmoil or economic uncertainty. Illiquid and relatively less liquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing or volatile markets. Although the Fund primarily
seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This risk
may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate fixed-income holdings at the same time as the Fund,
causing increased supply of the Fund's underlying investments in the market and contributing to liquidity risk and downward pricing pressure. There can be no assurance that a security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be
liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The
market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. There may also be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than on public corporations. This means that it may be harder to buy and
sell</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>municipal securities, especially on short notice, and municipal securities may
be more difficult for the Fund to value accurately than securities of public corporations. Since the Fund invests a significant portion of its portfolio in municipal securities, the Fund’s portfolio may have greater exposure to liquidity risk
than a fund that invests in comparable non-municipal securities.</div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> The Fund may
not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of
constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and may be influenced by
price, currency and interest rate movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund may suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or uncertainty. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to
changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market,
industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally less sensitive to such changes than are
fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments. In addition, since many municipal securities are issued to finance
similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer, conditions in these industries can affect the overall municipal market.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in
Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and
sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange
prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized
Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or
redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more
trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of
trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making
small investments through a brokerage account.</div> <div>Municipal
Securities Risk.<font> Municipal securities are subject to the risk that litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, or the bankruptcy of the issuer
could have a significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest or otherwise affect the value of such securities.</font></div>
<div>Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political
or economic changes as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Because many municipal securities are
issued to finance similar projects, such as those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer, conditions in these sectors can affect the overall municipal market. In addition, changes in the financial
condition of an individual municipal insurer can affect the overall municipal market.</div>
<div>Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues
from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the tax benefits supporting the project or assets or the inability to collect revenues from the project or the assets. Municipal securities may be less
liquid than taxable bonds, and there may be less publicly available information on the financial condition of municipal security issuers than for issuers of other securities. There is no guarantee that the Fund’s income, that is derived from
municipal securities, will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, state income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” The Fund and BFA will rely on the opinion of
issuers’ bond counsel on the tax-exempt status of interest on municipal bonds. Neither the Fund nor BFA will independently review the bases for those tax opinions, which may ultimately be determined to be incorrect, potentially resulting in
the Fund and its shareholders being subject to substantial tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,
regardless of their</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets
in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United States.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and
adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued
rise in the U.S. public debt level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program. Substitute
payments received by the Fund with respect to municipal securities lent, if any, will not constitute tax-exempt interest income to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> There is no guarantee
that the Fund’s income will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” The Index Provider relies on the bond issuer’s prospectus
disclosure of the opinion from its counsel as to the tax-exempt status of the investment. Similarly, for municipal bonds not represented in the Underlying Index, BFA relies on prospectus disclosure of the tax opinion from the bond issuer’s
counsel. Neither BFA nor the Fund guarantees that these opinions are correct, and there is no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) will agree with the bond issuer’s counsel’s tax opinion. Issuers or other
parties generally enter into covenants requiring continuing compliance with U.S. federal tax requirements to preserve the tax-free status of interest payments over the life of the security. If at any time the covenants are not complied with, or if
the IRS otherwise determines that the issuer did not comply with relevant tax requirements, interest payments from a security could become federally taxable, possibly retroactively to the date the security was issued, and the security could decline
significantly in value. For municipal bonds not included in the Underlying Index, BFA will generally seek to obtain bonds that pay interest that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare</font></div> </div>

<div>contribution tax. The interest on any money market instruments or other cash
equivalents held by the Fund may be subject to the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax.</div>
<div>Events occurring after the date of issuance of a municipal bond
or after the Fund’s acquisition of a municipal bond may result in a determination that interest on that bond is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax, federal AMT or federal Medicare contribution tax purposes retroactively to
its date of issuance. Such a determination may cause a portion of prior distributions by the Fund to its shareholders to be taxable to those shareholders in the year of receipt. U.S. federal or state changes in income, federal AMT or federal
Medicare contribution tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. If the IRS determines an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable
tax requirements, interest from the security could become taxable, even retroactively, and the securities could decline significantly in value.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> Tracking
error is the divergence of a fund’s performance from that of the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in
the applicable underlying index, pricing differences, differences in transaction costs, the fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to
the applicable underlying index or the costs to the fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error
also may result because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while the applicable underlying index does not.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price
the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are
valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time
periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies.</div> <div>Close-out
Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Recently adopted regulations of the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of
U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating
to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a</font></div> </div>

<div>specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings
and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</div>
<div>School District Investment
Risk.<font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school districts may be adversely
affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular school district
project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Furthermore,
litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of financing public education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of states, and legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school finances in some states, any
of which may adversely affect school district investments.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested
to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Infrastructure Industry Risk.<font> The transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, in certain countries, significant government
regulation and oversight. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, toll roads) often depend on
revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the
transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The
utilities sector may be adversely affected by deregulation, which can lead to increased competition; difficulty raising capital and financing large construction programs during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulations; costs associated with technical innovations; the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made disasters. In addition, existing and
possible future regulations or legislation may reduce the profitability of the utilities sector or subject the sector to greater risks of loss. Energy conservation and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>prolonged changes in climatic conditions may also adversely impact the
utilities sector. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular utility

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.18%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order
to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock. As of December 31, 2017, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.28 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in
the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board
of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended October 31.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and their affiliates, directors, partners, trustees, managing members, officers and employees (collectively, the
“Affiliates”)) in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and the other Affiliates provide
investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and the other Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and
asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more of the other Affiliates acts, or may act,
as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, agent or principal, and have other direct and
indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in,
engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which BFA or an Affiliate performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities
of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund also

products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Affiliates in
connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions.</div>
<div>BFA or an Affiliate may engage in proprietary trading and
advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund, including securities issued by
other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The
trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or
having interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>No Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment
opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other
accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also
possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time,
enter into transactions in which BFA’s or an Affiliate’s other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by Affiliate-advised clients may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more
Affiliate-advised clients or by BFA may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will retain a share of the
securities lending revenues. BFA or an Affiliate will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of cash collateral. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under
the securities lending program.</div> <div>The activities of BFA or
the Affiliates may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the Fund's SAI for further

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IBMJ.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying
securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15
seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets
and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best
possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations
and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if
such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern
time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the</font></div> </div>

<div>U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is
calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the
nearest cent.</div> <div>The value of the securities and other
assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with valuation policies and procedures approved
by the Board. Pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round
lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with
sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares. In general, given its investment strategy, the Fund would not be an appropriate investment for a tax deferred retirement account such as an IRA or a tax-exempt investor.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.</div>
<div>Dividends paid by the Fund that are properly reported as
tax-exempt interest dividends will not be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax. The Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation,
including the federal AMT. Dividends paid by the Fund will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of
the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded from gross income for</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>U.S. federal income tax purposes and as long as the Fund properly reports such
dividends as tax-exempt interest dividends. Exempt interest dividends from interest earned on municipal securities of a state, or its political subdivisions, may be exempt from income tax in that state. However, income from municipal securities of
other states generally will not qualify for tax-free treatment.</div>
<div>Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income other
than from net tax-exempt income, including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net
long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible
for taxation at a maximum rate of 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Taxable distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on “net
investment income,” for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. Distributions from the Fund are not expected to qualify as qualified dividend income. In general, any
taxable distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary
income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount. To the extent the Fund does not include the market discount in income as it
accrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount.<br/> </div>
<div>If you lend your Fund shares pursuant to securities lending
arrangements, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as tax-exempt income. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their account holders, or

<div>and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities
with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain
exceptions apply.</div> <div>If you are a resident or a citizen of
the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Shareholders will receive information after the end of each
year setting forth the amount of dividends and long-term capital gains distributed to them by the Fund during the prior year. Likewise, the amount of tax-exempt income, including any tax-exempt income subject to AMT, that the Fund distributes will
be reported and such income must be reported on the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return. The AMT is a separate tax system that operates in parallel to the regular federal income tax system but eliminates many deductions and
exclusions. The AMT has different tax rates and treats as taxable certain types of income that are nontaxable for regular income tax purposes. The interest on certain “private activity” municipal bonds is taxable income for AMT purposes.
If a taxpayer’s overall AMT liability is higher than regular income tax liability, then the taxpayer owes the regular income tax liability plus the difference between the AMT liability and the regular income tax liability.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) (“Deposit
Securities”) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally
corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation baskets will generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Fund. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation
Units partially or solely for cash.</div> <div>Similarly, shares can
be redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund (“Fund Securities”) and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>The Deposit Securities required for purchase of a Creation Unit
may be different than the Fund Securities the Fund will deliver upon redemption of Fund shares. The Deposit Securities and Fund Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit, generally will correspond <font>pro rata</font>, to the extent practicable, to the securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> <div>The following table shows, as of
November 30, 2017, the approximate value of one Creation Unit, standard fees and maximum additional charges for creations and redemptions (as described above and in the Fund's SAI):</div> <div>

<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented
here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of October 31, 2017</div>

will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2022 Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of
investment-grade (as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)), non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing in 2022. As of October 31, 2017, there were 7,893 issues in the Underlying
Index.</div> <div>The Underlying Index includes municipal bonds
primarily from issuers that are state or local governments or agencies such that the interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). Each bond must have a rating of at least
BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”), or BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. To
remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each rebalancing date. All bonds in the</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index will mature after December 31, 2021 and before December 2,
2022. Bonds that mature or are pre-refunded in their respective year of maturity do not accrue interest past the maturity or pre-refund date. All payments related to the maturity or pre-refunding of a bond are reinvested in tax-exempt cash or cash
equivalents for the duration of each month.</div> <div>The Fund is a
series of the iShares iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series of bond exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) sponsored by BlackRock, Inc.
(“BlackRock”). The iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series do not invest in U.S. savings bonds or other U.S. government bonds and are not designed
to provide protection against inflation.</div> <div>BFA uses a
“passive” or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions
when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may
eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance
by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The

<div>selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics
(based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying
index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including
shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to
time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund will generally hold municipal bond securities issued
by state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income,” including dividends, interest and capital
gains. In the last months of operation,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in
bonds but instead will be held in cash and cash equivalents, including, without limitation, shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and municipal commercial
paper. These cash equivalents may not be included in the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2022, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate, and its
net assets will be distributed to then-current shareholders. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government

industry.</div> <div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of this prospectus (“the Prospectus”)), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, or asset class.</div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial
condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cyber
Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>

<div>generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower
than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that
vary over time. It is expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity. Unlike a direct
investment in municipal bonds, the breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the Fund's existence it may make distributions at a greater
(or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which will result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely
affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis,
you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature or are near
maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and
may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, increases the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund invests in municipal bonds of issuers that are primarily state or local
governments or agencies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>

<div>to purchase or sell. This can reduce the Fund's returns because the Fund may
be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. The Fund invests a significant portion of its portfolio in municipal securities, which may be less liquid than comparable taxable bonds.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political or economic changes as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to
taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively
affected by the inability to collect revenues from the project or the assets. In the event of a default or insolvency, certain issuers of municipal bonds may be subject to proceedings other than those specified by U.S. bankruptcy</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>laws, which may impact the Fund’s ability to ultimately recover
assets.</div> <div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service
providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address
every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United States<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities
to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Securities Lending
Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a
timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger
adverse tax consequences for the Fund. Substitute payments received by the Fund with respect to municipal</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

between the securities and other instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in the applicable underlying index, pricing differences, differences in transaction costs, the fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in
timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to the fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market
volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while the applicable underlying index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets
that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or assets in the
Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div> </div> <div> <div type="Block"> </div>

price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund will wind up and terminate on or about December 1,
2022. Upon its termination, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In the final months of the
Fund's operations, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and
municipal commercial paper. By December 2, 2022, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in this manner. As the Fund approaches its termination date, its holdings of money market or similar funds may increase, causing the
Fund to incur the fees and expenses associated with investing in these funds. In accordance with the Trust's current Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Fund will terminate on or about the date noted above as approved by a
majority of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) without requiring additional approval by Fund shareholders. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board determines the extension to be in the best interest
of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of
the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences
between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time
to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance
on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated
to reflect such change or adjustment.</div> <div>“Tracking
error” is the divergence of the performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling
indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in its underlying
index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under new continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's
listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not
comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to
rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets. This may cause the Fund to underperform other
investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk. <font>The Fund may be more susceptible to an increased risk of loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of issuers in a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may be
subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences than the market as a whole.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk.<font> Credit risk is the
risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal payments when due or
otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or
counterparty’s credit rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share
price.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents
can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber attacks may also be carried out in
a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network
services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians,
transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially
resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the
inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In
addition, cyber attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans
and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service
providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During
the eleven months prior to the Fund's planned termination date, the bonds held by the Fund will mature and the Fund’s portfolio will convert to cash or cash equivalents. During these final eleven months, the Fund’s yield will generally
tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</font></div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk. <font>The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over time. It is expected that an investment in the
Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity to those held by the Fund, but unlike a direct investment in municipal bonds, the
breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment. The Fund may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio,
which will result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The breakdown between Fund distribution payments and the amount of liquidation proceeds may adversely affect the tax
characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may
experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. In addition, the yield on your investment (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the return on your purchase price) may be lower (or
higher) than the Fund's published yields, which are based on the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.<font> The Fund’s
income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, as bonds in its portfolio mature or are near maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted,</font></div>

<div>or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index
Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Therefore, gains, losses or costs associated with errors of the Index Provider or its agents will generally be
borne by the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other
constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> As interest
rates rise, the value of a fixed-income security held by the Fund is likely to decrease. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with
shorter durations. To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer-term durations, which is expected to occur to a greater degree earlier in the life of the Fund, rising interest rates
may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline significantly. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. In
addition, decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed-income markets.</div>
<div>The historically low interest rate environment was created in
part by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero percent. The Fed recently raised its benchmark
interest rate several times as the U.S. labor market strengthened and economic activity accelerated. The Fed indicated that it expects its accommodative monetary policy stance to support strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to
target inflation, which increases the likelihood of rising interest rates in the future. Fed policy going forward is less clear given recent changes in Fed leadership. Because the Fund holds a portfolio of securities set to mature at approximately
the same time, the Fund generally will have greater exposure to interest rate risk earlier in its life than closer to its termination date.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>Changes in the
financial condition of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect a security’s or
instrument’s credit quality or value. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk. <font>Liquidity risk
exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. To the extent the Fund invests in illiquid securities or securities that become less liquid, such investments may have a negative effect on the returns of the Fund because the
Fund may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed-income securities or the lack of an active market for such securities. Liquid investments may
become illiquid or less liquid, particularly during periods of market turmoil or economic uncertainty. Illiquid and relatively less liquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing or volatile markets. Although the Fund primarily
seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This risk
may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate fixed-income holdings at the same time as the Fund,
causing increased supply of the Fund's underlying investments in the market and contributing to liquidity risk and downward pricing pressure. There can be no assurance that a security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be
liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The
market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. There may also be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than on public corporations. This means that it may be harder to buy and
sell</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>municipal securities, especially on short notice, and municipal securities may
be more difficult for the Fund to value accurately than securities of public corporations. Since the Fund invests a significant portion of its portfolio in municipal securities, the Fund’s portfolio may have greater exposure to liquidity risk
than a fund that invests in comparable non-municipal securities.</div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> The Fund may
not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of
constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and may be influenced by
price, currency and interest rate movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund may suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or uncertainty. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to
changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market,
industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally less sensitive to such changes than are
fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments. In addition, since many municipal securities are issued to finance
similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer, conditions in these industries can affect the overall municipal market.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in
Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and
sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange
prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized
Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or
redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more
trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of
trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making
small investments through a brokerage account.</div> <div>Municipal
Securities Risk.<font> Municipal securities are subject to the risk that litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, or the bankruptcy of the issuer
could have a significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest or otherwise affect the value of such securities.</font></div>
<div>Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political
or economic changes as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Because many municipal securities are
issued to finance similar projects, such as those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer, conditions in these sectors can affect the overall municipal market. In addition, changes in the financial
condition of an individual municipal insurer can affect the overall municipal market.</div>
<div>Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues
from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the tax benefits supporting the project or assets or the inability to collect revenues from the project or the assets. Municipal securities may be less
liquid than taxable bonds, and there may be less publicly available information on the financial condition of municipal security issuers than for issuers of other securities. There is no guarantee that the Fund’s income, that is derived from
municipal securities, will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, state income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” The Fund and BFA will rely on the opinion of
issuers’ bond counsel on the tax-exempt status of interest on municipal bonds. Neither the Fund nor BFA will independently review the bases for those tax opinions, which may ultimately be determined to be incorrect, potentially resulting in
the Fund and its shareholders being subject to substantial tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,

<div>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets
in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United States.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and
adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued
rise in the U.S. public debt level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program. Substitute
payments received by the Fund with respect to municipal securities lent, if any, will not constitute tax-exempt interest income to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> There is no guarantee
that the Fund’s income will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” The Index Provider relies on the bond issuer’s prospectus
disclosure of the opinion from its counsel as to the tax-exempt status of the investment. Similarly, for municipal bonds not represented in the Underlying Index, BFA relies on prospectus disclosure of the tax opinion from the bond issuer’s
counsel. Neither BFA nor the Fund guarantees that these opinions are correct, and there is no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) will agree with the bond issuer’s counsel’s tax opinion. Issuers or other
parties generally enter into covenants requiring continuing compliance with U.S. federal tax requirements to preserve the tax-free status of interest payments over the life of the security. If at any time the covenants are not complied with, or if
the IRS otherwise determines that the issuer did not comply with relevant tax requirements, interest payments from a security could become federally taxable, possibly retroactively to the date the security was issued, and the security could decline
significantly in value. For municipal bonds not included in the Underlying Index, BFA will generally seek to obtain bonds that pay interest that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare</font></div> </div>

equivalents held by the Fund may be subject to the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax.</div>
<div>Events occurring after the date of issuance of a municipal bond
or after the Fund’s acquisition of a municipal bond may result in a determination that interest on that bond is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax, federal AMT or federal Medicare contribution tax purposes retroactively to
its date of issuance. Such a determination may cause a portion of prior distributions by the Fund to its shareholders to be taxable to those shareholders in the year of receipt. U.S. federal or state changes in income, federal AMT or federal
Medicare contribution tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. If the IRS determines an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable
tax requirements, interest from the security could become taxable, even retroactively, and the securities could decline significantly in value.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> Tracking
error is the divergence of a fund’s performance from that of the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in
the applicable underlying index, pricing differences, differences in transaction costs, the fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to
the applicable underlying index or the costs to the fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error
also may result because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while the applicable underlying index does not.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price
the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are
valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time
periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies.</div> <div>Close-out
Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Recently adopted regulations of the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of
U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating
to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a</font></div> </div>

<div>specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings
and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</div>
<div>School District Investment
Risk.<font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school districts may be adversely
affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular school district
project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Furthermore,
litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of financing public education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of states, and legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school finances in some states, any
of which may adversely affect school district investments.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested
to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Infrastructure Industry Risk.<font> The transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, in certain countries, significant government
regulation and oversight. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, toll roads) often depend on
revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the
transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The
utilities sector may be adversely affected by deregulation, which can lead to increased competition; difficulty raising capital and financing large construction programs during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulations; costs associated with technical innovations; the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made disasters. In addition, existing and
possible future regulations or legislation may reduce the profitability of the utilities sector or subject the sector to greater risks of loss. Energy conservation and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.18%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order
to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock. As of December 31, 2017, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.28 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in
the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board
of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended October 31.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and their affiliates, directors, partners, trustees, managing members, officers and employees (collectively, the
“Affiliates”)) in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and the other Affiliates provide
investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and the other Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and
asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more of the other Affiliates acts, or may act,
as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, agent or principal, and have other direct and
indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in,
engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which BFA or an Affiliate performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities
of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund also
may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Affiliates in
connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions.</div>
<div>BFA or an Affiliate may engage in proprietary trading and
advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund, including securities issued by
other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The
trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or
having interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>No Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment
opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other
accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also
possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time,
enter into transactions in which BFA’s or an Affiliate’s other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by Affiliate-advised clients may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more
Affiliate-advised clients or by BFA may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will retain a share of the
securities lending revenues. BFA or an Affiliate will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of cash collateral. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under
the securities lending program.</div> <div>The activities of BFA or
the Affiliates may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the Fund's SAI for further

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IBMK.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act restricts investments by
investment companies in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules
or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered
investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying
securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15
seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets
and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best
possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations
and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if
such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern
time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the</font></div> </div>

<div>U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is
calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the
nearest cent.</div> <div>The value of the securities and other
assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with valuation policies and procedures approved
by the Board. Pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round
lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with
sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares. In general, given its investment strategy, the Fund would not be an appropriate investment for a tax deferred retirement account such as an IRA or a tax-exempt investor.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.</div>
<div>Dividends paid by the Fund that are properly reported as
tax-exempt interest dividends will not be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax. The Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation,
including the federal AMT. Dividends paid by the Fund will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of
the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded from gross income for</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>U.S. federal income tax purposes and as long as the Fund properly reports such
dividends as tax-exempt interest dividends. Exempt interest dividends from interest earned on municipal securities of a state, or its political subdivisions, may be exempt from income tax in that state. However, income from municipal securities of
other states generally will not qualify for tax-free treatment.</div>
<div>Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income other
than from net tax-exempt income, including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net
long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible
for taxation at a maximum rate of 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Taxable distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on “net
investment income,” for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. Distributions from the Fund are not expected to qualify as qualified dividend income. In general, any
taxable distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary
income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount. To the extent the Fund does not include the market discount in income as it
accrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount.<br/> </div>
<div>If you lend your Fund shares pursuant to securities lending
arrangements, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as tax-exempt income. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their account holders, or

<div>and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities
with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain
exceptions apply.</div> <div>If you are a resident or a citizen of
the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Shareholders will receive information after the end of each
year setting forth the amount of dividends and long-term capital gains distributed to them by the Fund during the prior year. Likewise, the amount of tax-exempt income, including any tax-exempt income subject to AMT, that the Fund distributes will
be reported and such income must be reported on the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return. The AMT is a separate tax system that operates in parallel to the regular federal income tax system but eliminates many deductions and
exclusions. The AMT has different tax rates and treats as taxable certain types of income that are nontaxable for regular income tax purposes. The interest on certain “private activity” municipal bonds is taxable income for AMT purposes.
If a taxpayer’s overall AMT liability is higher than regular income tax liability, then the taxpayer owes the regular income tax liability plus the difference between the AMT liability and the regular income tax liability.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) (“Deposit
Securities”) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally
corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation baskets will generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Fund. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation
Units partially or solely for cash.</div> <div>Similarly, shares can
be redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund (“Fund Securities”) and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>The Deposit Securities required for purchase of a Creation Unit
may be different than the Fund Securities the Fund will deliver upon redemption of Fund shares. The Deposit Securities and Fund Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit, generally will correspond <font>pro rata</font>, to the extent practicable, to the securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> <div>The following table shows, as of
November 30, 2017, the approximate value of one Creation Unit, standard fees and maximum additional charges for creations and redemptions (as described above and in the Fund's SAI):</div> <div>

an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented
here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of October 31, 2017</div>

<div>General Description of the Trust and the Funds</div>
<div>The Trust currently consists of more than 280 investment
series or portfolios. The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on December 16, 1999 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940
Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). This SAI relates to the following Funds:</div> <div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an “Underlying
Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at
their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities
for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on
national securities exchanges (a “Listing Exchange”) such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”) (formerly known as BATS Exchange, Inc.) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). Shares of the Funds are traded in the
secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI). Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI) typically
are a specified number of shares, generally 50,000 or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 115%, which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted
Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs
associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of
shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Listing Exchange
necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period beginning
upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which the Fund is based is no longer
calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also</div> </div>

<div>remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such
Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional information regarding the
indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or through other widely disseminated means, an updated
indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has a fixed-income securities component and a cash
component. The fixed-income securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a
Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Fund at a particular point in time because the current portfolio of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the
current Deposit Securities. Therefore, a Fund's IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund's NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an IOPV consists of estimated
accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share prices of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in both fixed-income securities issued by issuers that comprise the Underlying Index and through transactions that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not
actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities
that are in its underlying index.</div> <div>Although the Funds do
not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Each Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including
shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index. From time to
time when conditions warrant, however, each Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index. Additionally, under normal circumstances, each Fund will
invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”).
This policy is a fundamental policy of each Fund and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of such Fund’s outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition, the Funds may invest any cash assets in one or
more affiliated money market funds. In the last months of a Fund's operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in bonds, but instead will be held in cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation,

<div>Bonds.<font>  Each Fund invests
a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company, or U.S. or non-U.S. governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay
interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by corporations and governments to borrow money from investors.</font></div>
<div>An issuer may have the right to redeem or “call” a
bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear
interest income at a “coupon” rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s
yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is purchasing the
bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less current income
than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of bonds bear
interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar
final maturities. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but
their value may decline if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its
investment portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter
maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation’s earnings and assets and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be
unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. Under normal market conditions, any borrowing by a Fund will not exceed 10% of the
Fund’s net assets; however, each Fund generally does not intend to borrow money.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a
Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</div>
<div>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank
or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of
a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a
Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>

<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A non-diversified fund is a fund that is not limited by
the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant percentage of
the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by more
diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund (whether
diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution
requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Illiquid Securities.<font>
 Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities (calculated at the time of investment). Illiquid securities may include securities subject to contractual or other restrictions on resale and other
instruments that lack readily available markets, as determined in accordance with SEC staff guidance. The liquidity of a security relates to the ability to readily dispose of the security and the price to be obtained upon disposition of the
security, which may be lower than the price that would be obtained for a comparable, more liquid security. Illiquid securities may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid securities and a Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid securities
in a timely fashion or at their expected prices.</font></div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>
 Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market
value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the Fund exceeds one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the
collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities
that it would have received if the securities were not on loan. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the
loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such
investments are subject to investment risk.</div> <div>Each Fund
conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent
that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance
with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board” or the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments for dividends received by a Fund for securities loaned out by the
Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt
securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Ratings. <font> An
investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), or
another credit rating agency designated as a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by
S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered “investment-grade” securities, bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics, while bonds rated
BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are generally considered below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers
that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility
of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” and are subject to a substantial degree of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a
description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or
indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects
advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and
intends not to market itself as a “commodity pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool
operator” under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps,
currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through 2020.

<div>regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps
and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, a
Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of the Fund's obligations under the applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts
are settled on a physical basis, the Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis,
the Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of the Fund's obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on
physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund was relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires the security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale,
to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured
by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally
strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund, should it
decide to utilize them. Such risks are not unique to the Fund, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a
value equal to or greater than the Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in
additional securities.</font></div> <div>Securities of Investment
Companies. <font> Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940
Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one
investment company,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment
companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment companies, including but not limited to money market funds, including those advised by BFA
or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would
be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s <font>pro rata </font>share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>   Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to
provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations
of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's, “F-1” by Fitch or “A-1” by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or
if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining
maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii)
short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased
on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by
borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of
the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost a Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may
reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Insolvency Risk.<font>
 Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund
become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain. Insolvency of municipal issuers exposes
investors to increased uncertainty and risks as compared to corporate issuers because municipalities typically are not subject to formalized bankruptcy proceedings and there often is not a process whereby creditor claims can be considered and
addressed.</font></div> <div>During the period of a bankruptcy
proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or
restructuring will be completed, and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations
evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by each Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can be no assurance that the
securities or other assets received by each Fund in connection with such plan of</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income
potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or
security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund’s securities holdings in the
issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by each Fund could be re-characterized or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity securities. These types
of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase warrants and rights; equity interests
in trusts; and depositary receipts. The value of equity securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region
or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to
additional tracking error risk.</div> <div>To the extent that each
Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, each Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that each Fund could
receive is an interest in one or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. Each Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or
restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or downward pricing pressure after completion of the
reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If each Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring
with respect to securities of the issuer held by each Fund, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If each Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund may have more active participation in the
affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management Rule Risk.<font>  In October 2016, the SEC adopted a liquidity risk management rule requiring open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program
and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs . The Funds will be required to comply with portions of the rule by
December 1, 2018. The effect the rule will have on the Funds, including a Fund’s ability to rely on the exclusions, is not yet known, but the rule may impact a Fund’s performance and ability to achieve its investment
objective.</font></div> <div>Municipal Insurance. <font> A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the
time the bond is issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div>
<div>Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee timely
and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing its credit quality and value.</div>
<div>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market
fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Fund's share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security before maturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or interest caused by
negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond. A mandatory
sinking fund redemption may be a provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</div>
<div>Because a significant portion of the municipal securities
issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value of the securities insured by that insurance company and on
the municipal markets as a whole.</div> <div>Certain significant
providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme
credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into</div> </div> <div type="Block">

insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the
market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal security independent of insurance.</div>
<div>Municipal Market Disruption Risk. <font> The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities
holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before
state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Fund’s holdings would be affected, and the
Trustees would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. In many cases,
there may be no bankruptcy proceedings available to handle claims in the face of a municipal issuer’s default or insolvency. Although the issuers of the majority of the bonds targeted for investment by each Fund is expected to have a
comparatively higher credit rating than municipal bond issuers that have defaulted on their obligations, there can be no assurance that those issuers will not default. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying
results among the states or among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular
securities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities.
<font> Each Fund invests in securities issued by states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or authorities. Municipal
securities share the attributes of debt/fixed-income securities in general, but are generally issued by states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or
authorities. The municipal securities which the Funds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or revenue bonds), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law. General
obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Limited obligation bonds are payable only from the revenues
derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source. Industrial development bonds generally are also revenue bonds and thus are not payable from the
issuer’s general revenues. The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility
of the corporate user (and/or any guarantor). The Funds may invest in private activity bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or
port facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for
the construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately operated industrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of such
issues.</font></div> <div>As each Fund approaches its termination
date, it will transition its holdings to tax-free instruments including, without limitation, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes and
bond anticipation notes; variable rate demand notes and obligations; tender option bonds; and municipal commercial paper.</div>
<div>Municipal notes are shorter-term municipal debt obligations.
They may provide interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully
repaid, and the Funds may lose money.</div> <div>Municipal
commercial paper is generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out of the
assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</div>
<div>Tender option bonds are synthetic floating-rate or
variable-rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are then issued to investors, such as the</div> </div>

<div>Funds, evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The remarketing agent for
the trust sets a floating or variable rate on typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to purchase the short-term floating-rate interests at their original
purchase price upon the occurrence of certain specified events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating-rate interests upon the occurrence of certain other events, for example, the downgrading of the municipal
bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below investment grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating rate interests
the most severe credit risks associated with the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the municipal bonds.
Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives, and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the Funds invest in
tender option bonds, it is also exposed to credit risk associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</div>
<div>Variable rate demand obligations (“VRDOs”) are
tax-exempt obligations that contain a floating or variable interest rate adjustment formula and a right of demand on the part of the holder thereof to receive payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest upon a short notice period
not to exceed seven days. There is the possibility that because of default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals (ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market
rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. The adjustments typically are based upon the Public Securities
Association Index or some other appropriate interest rate adjustment index.</div>
<div>Because of the interest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not
comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates,
however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its shareholders will have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</div>
<div>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for
taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is generally characterized as a buy and hold investment
strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further away from such issuance date.</div>
<div>Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the
right to “put” or sell the security at par (face value) within a specified number of days following the investor's request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a security's liquidity by shortening its effective
maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience substantially more volatility.</div>
<div>Municipal securities are subject to credit and market risk.
Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</div>
<div>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a
variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue.
A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not be as extensive as that which is made available by
corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</div>
<div>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to
insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment
of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding
municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the payment of interest and principal on their
municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time
to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political
developments might affect all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in the same manner.</div>
<div>New or Unseasoned Municipal Issuers. <font> A Fund may invest in municipal securities issued by entities that have not previously issued securities or that do not have an extensive history of issuing securities. Information regarding these issuers may be
more limited than for other issuers. Securities of these issuers may be subject to volatility in their prices and may have a limited trading market, which could adversely affect a Fund’s ability to dispose of them and could reduce the price a
Fund might be able to obtain for them.</font></div> <div>Operational
Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or
technology failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in
the setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid
and mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to
completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div>Repurchase Agreement Risk.
<font> A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the
seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to
the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase
price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the
security declines, a Fund may lose money.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Derivatives. <font> A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or
an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to conventional
securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities.
Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to
prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities. <font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of each Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general information. You should
consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in shares is made through a tax-exempt
entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div>
<div>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years,
governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing
difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience ratings downgrades of their debt.</div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in the United States. <font> Decreasing imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Policy and
legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S.
public debt level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which a Fund
invests.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depends heavily on
corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash flows,
tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates, corporate tax
rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on
commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices have
recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil
industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other
risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by federal, state and
local governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may
materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> <div>Most financial companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for
companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund
invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default.
Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In
particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In
addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be
significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,
aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to
control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain
countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the
industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and
pollution control.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Information
Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies,
information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new
product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be
more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.
Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in
service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> <div>Operations
Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> </div>

<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest
rates.</font></div> <div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of
its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The
stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
transportation industry group.</font></div> <div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Materials
Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical progress, labor
relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production
of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities Issued By School
Districts. <font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school districts may be
adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular school
district project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities.
Furthermore, litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of financing public education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of states, and legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school finances in some
states, any of which may adversely affect school district investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and
potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory
approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world,
specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet
increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be
susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material
adverse effect on their businesses.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in
the Transportation Infrastructure Industry. <font> Municipal securities include, among others, bonds payable from fuel taxes and tolls for municipal toll roads, as well as general airport bonds. Issuers in the
transportation infrastructure industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and airports. Municipal securities
that are issued to finance a particular transportation project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the
issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government
decisions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities
Sector. <font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. Various
future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of
environmental and other governmental regulations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments
affecting a particular utility project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. Gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from
other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices
may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</font></div>
<div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>The Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each
Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to BFA’s proxy voting guidelines and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines”). Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the
best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA
maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a
Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to
ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine
to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law. Copies of the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy and the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines are
attached as Appendix A.</div> <div>Information with respect to how
BFA voted proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities during the 12-month period ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website at <font>www.iShares.com</font>; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy regarding the disclosure of the
Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests of each Fund’s shareholders; (ii) does not put the

current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other current or
prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that
invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of a Fund for the purpose of facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the
procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting the use of such information are in effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities
Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based subscription services, large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and
redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market makers and other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's portfolio holdings information
is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee-based subscription services, including market
makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such
potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business day.</div>
<div>Daily access to information concerning the Funds' portfolio
holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of
the Funds' investment adviser, the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who deal directly with, or assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody,
securities lending and fund accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In addition, each Fund discloses its fixed-income and/or equity
portfolio holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made available in connection
with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings
other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the
ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund will disclose its complete portfolio holdings
schedule in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will provide such information to shareholders as required by federal
securities laws and regulations thereunder. A Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the
SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a manner that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made
available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information available to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div>
<div>The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer or his delegate may
authorize disclosure of portfolio holdings information pursuant to the above policy and procedures, subject to restrictions on selective disclosure imposed by applicable law.</div>
<div>The Board reviews the policy and procedures for disclosure of
portfolio holdings information at least annually.</div>

<div>The S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes</div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> General
oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P indexes, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by an S&amp;P Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to these investments, is the
responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&amp;P DJI”) staff specialized in the various fixed-income markets. Public announcements of index changes as the result of committee
decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</font></div>

<div>S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2021 Index<sup>TM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 9,619</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2021 Index<sup>TM</sup> is a broad, comprehensive, market value weighted index designed to
measure the performance of investment-grade, non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing in 2021. As of October 31, 2017, the Underlying Index consisted of 9,619 bonds, with a total market value of $87.4 billion.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> In order
for a bond to be classified as eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a bond must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is a state or local government or agency such that interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal
income taxes and the federal AMT as determined by the Index Provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by
Moody's, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated by only one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the index. A bond with an “expected” rating, as denoted by data providers, of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings,
Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch will qualify for the index as well. For the avoidance of doubt, the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment grade; and (iv) each bond in the Underlying Index must have a minimum
maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum maturity
par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of six days prior to last Business Day of each month (“Rebalancing Reference Date”). “Business Day” is defined as any day that U.S. municipal bonds are traded, as determined
by The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and/or the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). All bonds in the Underlying Index will mature after December 31, 2020 and before December 2, 2021. When a bond that is included in
the Underlying Index matures, its maturity value will be represented in the Underlying Index by cash throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2021, the Underlying Index value will be represented by cash as no securities
will remain in the Underlying Index. At each monthly rebalancing, no index constituent can represent more than 30% of the weight of the Underlying Index, and the five highest weighted index constituents do not account for more than 65% of the weight
of the index in aggregate. The following types of bonds are specifically excluded from the Underlying Index: bonds subject to AMT, bonds with early redemption dates (callable provisions), tobacco bonds, non-rated bonds, notes, taxable municipals,
variable rate debt, commercial paper, derivative securities (inverse floaters, forwards, and swaps).</font></div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font>
Eligible bonds are approved by the S&amp;P Index Committee that oversees the management of the Underlying Index and are added to the Underlying Index on the next Rebalancing Reference Date, subject to the schedule of the monthly rebalancing
procedures.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance.<font> The Underlying Index is a market value weighted index. S&amp;P's pricing division, Standard &amp; Poors Securities Evaluations, Inc., reports the price of each bond in the index each day. The prices used in the index
calculation will add the accrued interest for each bond to the price reported by S&amp;P. The total return is calculated by aggregating the interest return, reflecting the return due to paid and accrued interest, and principal return, reflecting the
capital gains or losses due to changes in S&amp;P's end-of-day price and principal repayments and the reinvestment return, reflecting the reinvestment of related cash flows. The Underlying Index is generally reviewed and rebalanced on a monthly
basis. The S&amp;P Index Committee, nevertheless, reserves the right to make adjustments to an Underlying Index at any time that it believes appropriate. Additions, deletions and other changes to an Underlying Index arising from the monthly

<div>Investment Restrictions</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted its investment objective as a
non-fundamental investment policy. Therefore, each Fund may change its investment objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder approval. The Board has adopted as fundamental policies the following numbered investment restrictions, which
cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the Investment Company Act as the lesser of (i)
67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund.</div> <div>Each Fund may not:</div>

<div>Notations Regarding the Funds' Fundamental Investment
Restrictions</div> <div>The following notations are not considered
to be part of each Fund's fundamental investment restrictions and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, the Fund currently utilizes any one
or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to how to
classify issuers within or among industries.</div> <div>With
respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose,</div>
</div> <div type="Block"> <div>22</div>
</div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<a name="c51a7898-0f1a-4de2-ab86-af04ae73fa92_23"> </a> <div> <a href="#sai_toc">
 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other
lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of
at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund's total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings.
Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the
Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or
enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to permit
each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into
offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the
policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment
Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund's underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the
Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities
may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will
be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged
in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>
<div>Under its non-fundamental investment restrictions, which may
be changed by the Board without shareholder approval, each Fund may not:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>a. </td>
<td>Purchase securities of other
investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on
Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of
subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>b.
 </td>
<td>Make
short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's
fundamental or non-fundamental investment restrictions apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations
or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.</div>
<div>Under normal circumstances, each Fund will invest at least 80%
of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax, including AMT. This</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>policy is a fundamental policy of each Fund and may not be changed without a
vote of a majority of each Fund's outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act. Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least
80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in component securities in each Fund's Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’
prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Funds into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental limitation such that,
under normal market conditions, any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's net assets.</div>
<div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Trustees and Officers.
<font> The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or
she resigns, is removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not “interested
persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (“Independent Trustees”).</font></div>
<div>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its
affiliates (the “BlackRock-advised Funds”) are organized into one complex of closed-end funds, two complexes of open-end funds and one complex of ETFs (“Exchange-Traded Fund Complex”) (each, a “BlackRock Fund
Complex”). Each Fund is included in the BlackRock Fund Complex referred to as the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees a total
of 347 funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Drew E. Lawton, from October 2016 to June 2017, and Richard L. Fagnani, from April 2017 to June 2017, served as members of the advisory board (“Advisory Board,” members of which are
“Advisory Board Members”) for the Trust, iShares, Inc. and iShares U.S. ETF Trust with respect to all funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Mark K. Wiedman, Charles Park, Martin Small and
Benjamin Archibald, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito, Mr. Wiedman, Mr. Park, Mr. Small and Mr. Archibald</div> </div>

<div>The Board has concluded that, based on each Trustee’s
experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, each Trustee should serve as a Trustee of the Board. Among the attributes common to all Trustees are their ability to review
critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the Funds' investment adviser, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective
business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. A Trustee’s ability to perform his or her duties effectively may have been attained through the Trustee’s educational background or professional training; business,
consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as a Board member of the Funds and the other funds in the Trust (and any predecessor funds), other investment funds, public companies, or non-profit entities or other
organizations; and/or other life experiences. Also, set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee that led the Board to conclude that he or she should serve (or continue to
serve) as a Trustee.</div> <div>Robert S. Kapito has been a Trustee
of the Trust since 2009. Mr. Kapito has served as a Director of iShares, Inc. since 2009, a Trustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust since 2011 and a Director of BlackRock, Inc. since 2006. Mr. Kapito served as a Director of iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF,

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of ten members, eight of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to
review and address the policies and practices of</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each
standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each
standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and
structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent
Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses
key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review
risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal
counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment
performance or other activities.</div> <div>Committees of the Board
of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Charles A. Hurty (Chair), Richard L. Fagnani, John E. Kerrigan and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit
Committee are to assist the Board (i) in its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's
financial statements and the independent audit thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any
proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and
independent audits; and (vi) to assume such other responsibilities as may be delegated by the Board. The Audit Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.</font></div>
<div>The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
Madhav V. Rajan (Chair), Jane D. Carlin, Drew E. Lawton and John E. Martinez, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee nominates individuals for Independent Trustee membership on the Board and recommends
appointments to the Advisory Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee functions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) reviewing the qualifications of any person properly identified or nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee;
(ii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy
for a position of Independent Trustee(s) on the Board; (iii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the size and composition of the Board and Board committees and whether they comply with applicable laws and regulations; (iv)
recommending a current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of compensation for the Independent

affiliated persons of one another under the 1940 Act. Certain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and their affiliates (collectively, “BlackRock”) and PNC and its affiliates (collectively, “PNC” and together with BlackRock,
“Affiliates”), with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or PNC, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective affiliates (including, for these purposes, their directors, partners, trustees, managing members,
officers and employees), including the entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and
alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing a Fund. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may
be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div> <div>BlackRock and the other
Affiliates have proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or
that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as a Fund. One or more Affiliates are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of
customers and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, one or more Affiliates are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices
and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be
executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by a Fund.</div>
<div>When BlackRock and the other Affiliates seek to purchase or
sell the same assets for their managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in their good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may
adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or the other Affiliates may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur when investment decisions regarding a Fund are
based on research or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock or the other Affiliates implement a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with,
similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the
Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock or the other Affiliates may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain
activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding
a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock or the other Affiliates. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short by (and therefore benefit)
one or more Affiliates or their other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) one or more Affiliates or
their other accounts or funds.</div> <div>In certain circumstances,
BlackRock, on behalf of a Fund, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock or an Affiliate. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients or clients of
Affiliates (“cross trades”), including a Fund, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts
of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for a Fund. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the
parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates and their clients may
pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted
by the activities of BlackRock or the other Affiliates or their clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock and the other Affiliates for their proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) managed or advised by them. It is possible that one or
more Affiliate-managed accounts and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in
which one or more Affiliates or Affiliate-managed accounts achieve significant profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Affiliates or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or the other Affiliates
for clients worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the other Affiliates designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock and/or one or more Affiliates will not initiate or
recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Affiliates are performing services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of
one or more Affiliates for their proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the
aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may
have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by one or more Affiliates. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and
models. In addition, neither BlackRock nor any of the other Affiliates will have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed
by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock and the other
Affiliates, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by them or other customer accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>A Fund may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock and the other Affiliates for use by clients and financial advisors. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of a Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of
BlackRock are also principals or employees of Affiliates. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other entities or their clients and such obligations to other entities or clients may be a consideration of which
investors in a Fund should be aware.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or the other Affiliates, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or another Affiliate, serves as the counterparty, principal or
issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the
transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or the other Affiliates. One or more Affiliates may also create, write or issue derivatives for their clients, the
underlying securities, currencies or instruments of which may be those in which a Fund invests or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting
or other distribution by one or more Affiliates and may also enter into transactions with other clients of an Affiliate where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may cause departments of BlackRock
or the other Affiliates to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent affiliated transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock and the other Affiliates (except
with respect to BFA or affiliated sub-advisers of a Fund, as applicable) on an arms-length basis.</div>
<div>To the extent authorized by applicable law, one or more
Affiliates may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, markups, markdowns, financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing
and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by an Affiliate will be in its view commercially reasonable, although each Affiliate, including its sales personnel, will have an interest
in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to the Affiliate and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, the Affiliates (and their personnel
and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to a Fund or its
shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by a Fund or its shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by an Affiliate of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When an Affiliate acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in
other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, the Affiliate may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties
based on the Fund's own credit standing. Neither BlackRock nor any of the Affiliates will have any obligation to allow their credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the
Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock or any of the other Affiliates in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>Lending on behalf of a Fund is done by BTC pursuant to SEC
exemptive relief, enabling BTC to act as securities lending agent to, and receive a share of securities lending revenues from, the Fund. An Affiliate will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities
lending. There are potential conflicts of interest in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BTC as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend
particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BTC and its affiliates; and (ii) BTC as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As
described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro-rata allocation.</div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>

<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate pro-rata allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font>
indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when
aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal
opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by
the firm.</div> <div>Purchases and sales of securities and other
assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client and fund accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock,
however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts or funds are made separately, or if it determines that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, is not in the best interest
of a Fund, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>BlackRock may select brokers (including, without limitation,
Affiliates, to the extent permitted by applicable law) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or other Affiliates or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services
which provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the
extent permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and
products. Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the
research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client
accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate
benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for
those products and services itself.</div> <div>BlackRock does not
currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular
broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to
pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who,
pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose
not to engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where permitted, an Affiliate, and
request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts
related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div> <div>BlackRock
may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or the other Affiliates have an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing</div>

<div>client securities transactions for certain types of securities. These
ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and markups/markdowns, would
generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer
volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or
the other Affiliates, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting
Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible
that, from time to time, BlackRock or the other Affiliates may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may
contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the other Affiliates reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized
Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or the other Affiliates could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have
an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other
shareholders in deciding whether to redeem its shares but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or the other Affiliates has significant debt or equity
investments or other interests or in which an Affiliate makes a market. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such
investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or the other Affiliates. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or
use material non-public information acquired by any division, department or Affiliate of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of an Affiliate may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and
sales of securities. When an Affiliate is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities of an entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As
indicated below, BlackRock or the other Affiliates may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock or of an Affiliate have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co
transaction.</div> <div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates, their
personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of a Fund. With respect to BlackRock and the other Affiliates and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of a Fund
or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and the other Affiliates and their sales personnel may directly or
indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to a Fund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher
than for other products or services, and the remuneration and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>profitability to BlackRock or the other Affiliates and such personnel
resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of a Fund may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates and their personnel may
receive greater compensation or greater profit in connection with an account for which BlackRock serves as an adviser than with an account advised by an unaffiliated investment adviser. Differentials in compensation may be related to the fact that
BlackRock may pay a portion of its advisory fee to its Affiliate, or relate to compensation arrangements, including for portfolio management, brokerage transactions or account servicing. Any differential in compensation may create a financial
incentive on the part of BlackRock or the other Affiliates and their personnel to recommend BlackRock over unaffiliated investment advisers or to effect transactions differently in one account over another.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a
Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a
potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates may provide valuation
assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for their clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's
pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's
pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or
recommended by BlackRock.</div> <div>As disclosed in more detail in
the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s
investments are valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the
current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or
liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or
third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities
could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings
are valued by BlackRock (pursuant to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to
services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> <div>To
the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to
the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates and their directors,
officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or
constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers, employees and Affiliates that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by
this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock, Inc. have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who
normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be
obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Room, Washington, DC 20549-1520. Information about accessing documents on the SEC’s website may be obtained by calling the SEC

<div>BlackRock and the other Affiliates will not purchase
securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a
result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be
appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted
because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock or the other Affiliates and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock
would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or
related to companies for which an Affiliate is performing investment banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when an Affiliate is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities
of, or advisory services for, a company, the Funds may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company. In addition, when BlackRock provides advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be
prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company
(<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock or the other Affiliates serve as directors of companies the securities of
which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may
purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Affiliate, or are the subject of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where
personnel of BlackRock or the other Affiliates are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of one or more Affiliates for their
proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated
industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by
Affiliates (including BlackRock) for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the
Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either
through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business
transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights
(including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other
consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div> </div>

against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants violated
federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On September
18, 2017, the court issued a Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs have
appealed the court’s decision.</font></div> <div>Investment

<div>Investment Adviser. <font> BFA
serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, manages and administers the Trust and
the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to the Fund. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,
expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses

<div>Pursuant to BFA policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably
among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other factors, in which event the investment
opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the Funds may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than
it would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or
account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA
or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its
affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intends to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment
adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict-of-interest, which may result in the Portfolio Managers' favoring those portfolios or accounts

Portfolio Managers' compensation as of October 31, 2017.</div>
<div>Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio
managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year based on a number of
factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Base compensation.<font> Generally,
portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, Inc. and the individual's performance and
contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock, Inc.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The BlackRock, Inc. restricted
stock units, if properly vested, will be settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of annual
bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock, Inc.'s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.</font></div>
<div>Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards — <font>From time to time, long-term incentive equity awards are granted to certain key employees to aid in retention, align their interests with long-term shareholder interests and motivate performance. Equity awards are
generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that, once vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.</font></div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font>
In addition to base compensation and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font>
— BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution
equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($265,000 for 2015). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds
managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into an index target date fund that corresponds to, or is
closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to
the purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. James Mauro and Scott Radell are each eligible to participate in these plans.</font></div>
<div>As of October 31, 2017, the Portfolio Managers did not
beneficially own shares of the Funds.</div> <div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to
certain limitations, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds. The codes of ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism or other
illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information
will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from
persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow a Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds'
policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</div>
<div>Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.<font>   State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) serves as administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Funds under the Master Services Agreement and related Service Schedule (the
“Service Module”). State Street’s principal address is 1 Iron Street, Boston, MA 02210. Pursuant to the Service Module for Fund Administration and Accounting Services with the Trust, State Street provides necessary administrative,
legal, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, State Street makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to provide such
services. Pursuant to the Service Module for Custodial Services with the Trust, State Street maintains, in separate accounts, cash, securities and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and provides other
services. State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to deliver securities held by State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street is authorized to appoint certain foreign custodians or

in the applicable Prospectus and below in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may
be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own
resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA; however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the
collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04% (the “collateral investment fees”). Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>(i) Fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 80% of
securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div> </div>

<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day following the date
that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds the aggregate securities lending income earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex in calendar year 2013 (the Hurdle Date), each applicable fixed-income
fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for the remainder of that calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div>
<div>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes
collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent
fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved
list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating the terms of securities
loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing the delivery of loaned
securities; </div> <div>(4) monitoring the daily
value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary; </div>
<div>(5) investing cash collateral received in
connection with any loaned securities; </div>
<div>(6) monitoring distributions on loaned
securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </div>
<div>(7) in the event of default by a borrower
with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned securities; and </div>
<div>(8) terminating securities loans and
arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</div>
<div>The Funds had no income and fees/compensation related to its
securities lending activities during its most recent fiscal year.</div>
<div>Payments by BFA and its Affiliates.<font>  BFA and/or its affiliates (“BFA Entities”) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries (“Intermediaries”) for certain activities
related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or
indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded
products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting
systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing
Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote the
Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities
believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your
salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localizes the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries
and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann Advisor Network LLC, LPL Financial LLC, Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc. and UBS Financial Services Inc. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties
listed above that have occurred since the date noted above are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an

maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA
Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may

<div>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed
liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the
benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV
for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held by a Fund is as follows:</font></div>
<div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity
securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities exchange or through a market system
that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the Exchange on which the security is primarily
traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current
market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held
by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation Procedures”), BlackRock determines in good faith
that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty
days or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or
dealers as obtained from independent third-party pricing services. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each
tranche of the entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair
value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated
prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market
makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or
that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a
greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service
providers.</font></div> <div>All cash, receivables and current
payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their face value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services,
broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or
updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and
circumstances surrounding the revision.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the
date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers.</div>
<div>Certain of the securities acquired by a Fund may be traded on
foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized Participants can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a
Fund.</div> <div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S.
government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund
are determined as of such times.</div> <div>Use of fair value
prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s
performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Fair Value.<font> When market
quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance with the
Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of
trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies
significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to
the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred
after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held
by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market
or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that
would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock, with input from the BlackRock Investment Strategy
Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In
addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values
assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on
which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to
maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values
determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis
of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and
assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the
valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or
liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the
determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn
increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii)</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently
available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or
dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent
operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, less liquid securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons, including PNC and its affiliates, in connection
with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, PNC, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member
except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another
based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to
develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize
investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> <div>There were no brokerage commissions paid on

<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a Fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such Fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a Fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a Fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a Fund, the Trust or a Fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>Each Fund will wind up and terminate on or about December 1 of
the relevant year. Upon each Fund's termination, it will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In
accordance with the Declaration of Trust, each Fund will terminate on or about the date above as approved by a majority of the Board without requiring additional shareholder approval. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the
Board determines the extension to be in the best interest of the Fund.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through
subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and
reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</div>
<div>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede
&amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective
beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</div>
<div>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of
the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for
any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue
providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to
find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit
size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div> <div>Any
Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in
such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div>
<div>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</div>
<div>General.<font>  The Trust
issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on each Fund's NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as defined
below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the Listing Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to be placed earlier in the day. The following table sets forth
the number of shares of a Fund that constitute a Creation Unit for such Fund and the approximate value of such Creation Unit as of November 30, 2017:</font></div> <div>

reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a
corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The
consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally consists of the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund
Deposit,” which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and
subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing the Creation
Unit.</div> <div>To facilitate efficient management of each Fund
and to enable each Fund to track its Underlying Index, the Deposit Securities required for purchase of a Creation Unit may not be identical to the Fund Securities (as defined below under “Redemption of Creation Units”) a Fund will
deliver upon redemption of Fund shares. The Deposit Securities and Fund Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit, generally will correspond <font>pro rata</font>, to the
extent practicable, to the securities held by a Fund. Consistent with the exemptive orders granted to the Funds by the SEC, creation baskets will correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Underlying Index. As the planned
termination date of each Fund approaches, and particularly as the bonds held by the Fund begin to mature, the Fund expects to effect both creations and redemptions increasingly for cash.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC on each Business Day
prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number or par value of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the
end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of the Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made
available.</div> <div>The identity and number or par value of the
Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The
composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to permit or require the
substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing
process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or in certain other situations.</div> </div>

<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they
will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide
through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of
DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor. Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of
such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf
of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate
arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be
placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized
Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in
Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption
transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div>
<div>Placement of Creation Orders.<font>
 Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such as with Euroclear or DTC,
maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a “Central Depository Account”). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. The
Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern
time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or
cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account must be completed pursuant to the requirements
established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The “Settlement Date” for all funds is generally the second business day after the
Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose
determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street
generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the
Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the
second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the applicable Fund prior to such time.</font></div> </div>

<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To
initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to
receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the
Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an
Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper
submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted by
an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication
failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or
its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the
facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
with each Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> <div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon
the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to
the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div> <div>Each
Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the
currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences
to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or
(vii) circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a
shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 115%,
which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit Securities
for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash collateral
posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for
collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant
to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>
<div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and
redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions
are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund
and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized
Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or
partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades
resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs
associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time
to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant.
Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities
(as defined below). Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC, prior to the opening of
business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to
redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the corresponding Cash Amount (each
subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities
received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may
change from time to time.</div> <div>Unless cash redemptions are
available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the shares being redeemed, as next
determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund
Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized
Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the
event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally
redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities
that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the
same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash
Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div> <div>Costs
Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption
transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day.
If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses
related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a
Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be
charged a fee for such services.</font></div> <div>The following

<div>Placement of Redemption
Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of a Fund must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable request
to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed
earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized
Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The Authorized
Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular
broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant
Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to a Fund's transfer agent; such investors should allow
for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally
made within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). Each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 but by T+7, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances
and compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution to
distribution record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended beyond T+2 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a
holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</div> <div>If neither
the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to make
other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash,
and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined
after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund’s brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities).
Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash
to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions
of Creation Units, in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days
thereafter).</div> <div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized
Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to
10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to
deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least
equal to 105% and up to 115%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the day
after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall
be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized
Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Fund of purchasing such
shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or
restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other
circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div> <div>Taxation on
Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated
by taking the market value of the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon
the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund.
The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div> </div>

<div>Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a
Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on their investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income
must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or
forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at
least 90% of its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total
assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater
than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one
issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities
of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of
its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure
the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although in general the passive loss rules of the Internal
Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded
partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will
be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such
income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period
greater than two</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

with respect to certain of its assets (<font>i.e.</font>, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been
liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font></div>

98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have
been distributed by year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous
year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.
<font> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or
capital gain distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of
such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains
for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount
retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their
proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to
the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in
clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate
returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions
of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for
taxation at a maximum rate of 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital.
Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash
dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund
to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (i) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e</font>., the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares.<font>  Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax
basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales
charge by shifting his or her investment within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s
basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to
market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust
also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.<font>
 Dividends paid by a Fund that are properly reported as exempt-interest dividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Dividends paid on Fund shares that are loaned out pursuant to securities lending arrangements will not be
exempt from income tax. Each Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, including the federal AMT. In the last year of operation,
when a Fund’s target date is reached, the Fund may invest in AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, including tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes and bond anticipation
notes; municipal commercial paper; tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes and obligations. The 3.8% Medicare contribution tax (discussed above) will not apply to exempt interest dividends paid by a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividends paid by a Fund reported as exempt-interest dividends
will be exempt from federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the Fund’s net tax-exempt income as long as 50% or more of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is
invested in state, municipal or other bonds that are excluded from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends. Exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund
allocable to interest income from the municipal bonds of a particular state may be exempt from income taxation for shareholders who are residents of such state. Exempt-interest dividends from interest from municipal bonds of other states generally
are not so exempt. However, the receipt of exempt-interest dividends may require a shareholder to recharacterize a portion of certain non-taxable social security and railroad retirement benefit payments as taxable income. Shareholders should consult
their own tax advisors. A Fund may engage in derivative transactions with respect to obligations producing tax-exempt interest that may cause the Fund to not be treated as the owner of such obligations for purposes of the 50% threshold described
above.</div> <div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other
consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital),
accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types
of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize
income without receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate
tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in its books and records in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.  As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or
receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or
deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one
year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes
as ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise constitute ordinary deductions but are allocable under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net
tax-exempt income.</div> <div>Market Discount. <font> Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with
original issue discount (“OID”). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to
the extent of the accrued market discount.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S.
Investments.<font>  Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time the Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other
liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will
be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency
forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition
dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</font></div>
<div>Original Issue Discount.
<font> OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated
interest on such bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is
treated as original issue discount. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with
respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The
amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a
Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable year.</font></div>
<div>Reporting.<font>  If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of
a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in
respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its
circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this
exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form
W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S.
shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these rules to their accounts.</div>
<div>Distributions that a Fund reports as “short-term capital
gain dividends” or “long-term capital gain dividends” will not be treated as such to a recipient foreign shareholder if the distribution is attributable to gain received from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property or an
interest in a U.S. real property holding corporation and a Fund’s direct or indirect interests in U.S. real property exceeded certain levels. Instead, if the foreign shareholder has not owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a Fund at
any time during the one year period ending on the date of distribution, such distributions will be subject to 30% withholding by a Fund and will be treated as ordinary dividends to the foreign shareholder; if the foreign shareholder owned more than
5% of the outstanding shares of a Fund at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution, such distribution will be treated as real property gain subject to 21% withholding tax and could subject the foreign shareholder to
U.S. filing requirements. Additionally, if a Fund’s direct or indirect interests in U.S. real property were to exceed certain levels, a foreign shareholder realizing gains upon redemption from a Fund could be subject to the 21% withholding tax
and U.S. filing requirements unless more than 50% of a Fund’s shares were owned by U.S. persons at such time or unless the foreign person had not held more than 5% of a Fund’s outstanding shares throughout either such person’s
holding period for the redeemed shares or, if shorter, the previous five years.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items, and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to: (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their account holders, or
(ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities will need to provide the name, address and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will
be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. estate tax.</div>
<div>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S.
federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such shares, including consequences under

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock is the world’s preeminent asset management
firm and a premier provider of global investment management, risk management and advisory services to institutional and individual clients around the world. BlackRock offers a wide range of investment strategies and product structures to meet
clients’ needs, including individual and institutional separate accounts, mutual funds, closed-end funds, and other pooled investment vehicles and the industry-leading iShares exchange traded funds. Through BlackRock Solutions<sup>®</sup>, we offer risk management, strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock’s corporate governance program is focused on
protecting and enhancing the economic value of the companies in which it invests on behalf of clients. We do this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority, through voting
at shareholder meetings.</div> <div>We believe that there are
certain fundamental rights attached to share ownership. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ interests. Effective
voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or
by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, the distribution of income
and the capital structure. In order to exercise these rights effectively, we believe shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information to be able to take an informed view of the proposals, and of the performance of the company and
management.</div> <div>Our focus is on the board of directors, as
the agent of shareholders, which should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership to the management
and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on our behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote at shareholder meetings. Votes
cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the interests of shareholders or have not responded adequately to shareholder concerns
regarding strategy or performance.</div> <div>These principles set
out our approach to engaging with companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices vary internationally and our expectations in
relation to individual companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each market. However, as noted above, we do believe that there are some overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally. We assess voting matters
on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances. We are interested to understand from the company’s reporting its approach to corporate governance, particularly where it is different from the usual market
practice, and how it benefits shareholders.</div> <div>BlackRock
also believes that shareholders have responsibilities in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as stewardship. These ownership responsibilities include, in our view, engaging with management or board members on
corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term shareholder value creation.
Institutional shareholders also have responsibilities to their clients to have appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our own approach to oversight in relation to our corporate governance activities is set out in the section below titled
“BlackRock’s oversight of its corporate governance activities”.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets but we believe that there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The primary objective of our corporate governance activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these</div> </div> <div type="Block">

minimum we would expect companies to observe the accepted corporate governance standard in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach
taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the best interests of shareholders, we typically will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we take into account research from
proxy advisors, other internal and external research, information published by the company or provided through engagement and the views of our equity portfolio managers.</div>
<div>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity;
engagement provides BlackRock with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures, so that our voting decisions may be better informed. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and
approach to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. There are a range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company
and the market.</div> <div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of its engagements and sees the election of directors as one of its most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

<tr>
<td>•

<td>addressing

<div>There should be clear definitions of the role of the board,
the sub-committees of the board and the senior management such that the responsibilities of each are well understood and accepted. Companies should report publicly the approach taken to governance (including in relation to board structure) and why
this approach is in the interest of shareholders. We will engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the company or the performance of individual board
members. Concerns about directors may include their role on the board of a different company where that board has performed poorly and failed to protect shareholder interests.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order that
shareholders can assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>

that the operation of the board is enhanced when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to lead it. Where the chairman is also the CEO or is otherwise not independent the company should have an independent lead director. The
role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The
lead independent board director should be available to shareholders if they have concerns that they wish to discuss.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the diversity of experience and expertise of the current directors and how that might be augmented by incoming
directors. We believe that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the independent members of the board form a sub-committee to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these sub-committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party.</div>
<div>Auditors and audit-related issues</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial
statements which should provide a complete and accurate picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should also have in place a procedure for assuring annually the independence of the auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales and other special
transactions</div> <div>The capital structure of a company is
critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emption rights are a key protection for shareholders
against the dilution of their interests.</div> <div>In assessing
mergers, asset sales or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it.
We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may
seek reassurance from the board that executive and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related
parties, we would expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and would prefer only non-conflicted shareholders to vote on the proposal.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We would expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ being proposed by a
board to be subject to shareholder approval on introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Remuneration and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take into account the
specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation packages incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions consistent with
corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent accountable for poor
compensation practices or structures.</div> <div>BlackRock believes
that there should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance as reflected in returns to shareholders. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We support incentive plans
that pay out rewards earned over multiple and extended time periods. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be required to repay rewards where they were not justified
by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions should be reasonable in light
of market practice.</div> <div>Outside directors should be
compensated in a manner that does not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Social, ethical, and environmental issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well-managed companies will deal effectively with the social, ethical and
environmental (“SEE”) aspects of their businesses.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to identify and report on the
material, business-specific SEE risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and enhances the long-term
economic value of the company. The key performance indicators in relation to SEE matters should also be disclosed and performance against them discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps
shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the SEE aspects of the business. Any global standards adopted should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with SEE issues appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to
shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of SEE matters. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear and material economic
disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>More commonly, given that these are often not voting issues,
we will engage directly with the board or management. The trigger for engagement on a particular SEE concern is our assessment that there is potential for material economic ramifications for shareholders.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social, ethical or
political judgments on behalf of clients. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations
are contradictory or ambiguous.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>General corporate governance matters</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to timely
and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to influence
these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies helps shareholders assess whether the economic interests of shareholders have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. BlackRock believes shareholders
should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>BlackRock holds itself to a very high standard in its
corporate governance activities, including in relation to executing proxy votes. This function is executed by a team of dedicated BlackRock employees without sales responsibilities (the “Corporate Governance Group”), and which is
considered an investment function. BlackRock maintains three regional oversight committees (“Corporate Governance Committees”) for the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific, consisting of senior BlackRock
investment professionals. All of the regional Corporate Governance Committees report to a Global Corporate Governance Oversight Committee, which is a risk-focused committee composed of senior representatives of the active and index equity investment
businesses, the Deputy General Counsel, the Global Executive Committee member to whom the Corporate Governance Group reports and the head of the Corporate Governance Group. The Corporate Governance Committees review and approve amendments to their
respective proxy voting guidelines (“Guidelines”) and grant authority to the Global Head of Corporate Governance (“Global Head”), a dedicated BlackRock employee without sales responsibilities, to vote in accordance with the
Guidelines. The Global Head leads the Corporate Governance Group to carry out engagement, voting and vote operations in a manner consistent with the relevant Corporate Governance Committee’s mandate. The Corporate Governance Group engages
companies in conjunction with the portfolio managers in discussions of significant governance issues, conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to keep abreast of the field of corporate governance. The
Corporate Governance Group, or vendors overseen by the Corporate Governance Group, also monitor upcoming proxy votes, execute proxy votes and maintain records of votes cast. The Corporate Governance Group may refer complicated or particularly
controversial matters or discussions to the appropriate investors and/or regional Corporate Governance Committees for their review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s Equity Policy Oversight Committee (EPOC) is
informed of certain aspects of the work of the Global Corporate Governance Oversight Committee and the Corporate Governance Group.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>BlackRock carefully considers proxies submitted to funds and
other fiduciary accounts (“Funds”) for which it has voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which it has voting authority based on BlackRock’s evaluation of the best long-term economic
interests of shareholders, in the exercise of its independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or
BlackRock’s affiliates.</div> <div>When exercising voting
rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with its Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in
corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Corporate Governance Committees. The Corporate Governance Committees may, in the exercise of their business judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the
specific matter upon which a proxy vote is requested or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed-income securities or the securities of privately held issuers the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or the Corporate Governance Group based on their assessment of the particular transactions or
other matters at issue.</div> <div>In certain markets, proxy voting
involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder</div> </div>

<div>meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes;
(iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder
meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; and (vi) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting
rights such as shareblocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these markets
only on a “best-efforts” basis. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committees may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock clients not to vote proxies of companies in certain countries if the committee
determines that the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the issuer’s
proposal.</div> <div>While it is expected that BlackRock, as a
fiduciary, will generally seek to vote proxies over which BlackRock exercises voting authority in a uniform manner for all BlackRock clients, the relevant Corporate Governance Committee, in conjunction with the portfolio manager of an account, may
determine that the specific circumstances of such an account require that such account’s proxies be voted differently due to such account’s investment objective or other factors that differentiate it from other accounts. In addition,
BlackRock believes portfolio managers may from time to time legitimately reach differing but equally valid views, as fiduciaries for their funds and the client assets in those Funds, on how best to maximize economic value in respect of a particular
investment. Accordingly, portfolio managers retain full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item.</div>
<div>Conflicts management</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains policies and procedures that are designed
to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s
affiliates. Some of the steps BlackRock has taken to prevent conflicts include, but are not limited to:</div> <div>

<div>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and
proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The evaluation of the economic desirability of recalling loans involves balancing the revenue producing value of loans against the likely economic value of
casting votes. Based on our evaluation of this relationship, we believe that generally the likely economic value of casting most votes is less than the securities lending income, either because the votes will not have significant economic
consequences or because the outcome of the vote would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to ensure they are voted. Periodically, BlackRock analyzes the process and benefits of voting proxies for securities on loan, and
will consider whether any modification of its proxy voting policies or procedures is necessary in light of future conditions. In addition, BlackRock may in its discretion determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and
thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div> <div>Voting
guidelines</div> <div>The issue-specific voting Guidelines
published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. These Guidelines are not
intended to be exhaustive. BlackRock applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review.</div>
<div>As such, these Guidelines do not provide a guide to how
BlackRock will vote in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</div>

<div>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</div>
<div>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at
the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and
the ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a particular subsequent date.</div>
<div>Fixed-income securities which are unrated expose the investor
to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in
the evaluation of such securities.</div> <div>Investors should note
that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</div>
<div>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and
short-term obligations of an issuer.</div> <div>Moody’s
Ratings</div> <div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Aaa:<font> Obligations rated Aaa are
judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Aa:<font> Obligations rated Aa are
judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> Obligations rated A are
judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Baa:<font> Obligations rated Baa are
judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.</font></div>
<div>Ba:<font> Obligations rated Ba are
judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Obligations rated B are
considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Caa:<font> Obligations rated Caa are
judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Ca:<font> Obligations rated Ca are
highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Obligations rated C are the
lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> Moody's appends
numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the
modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div>Absence of Rating:<font> Where no
rating has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font></div>
<div>Should no rating be assigned, the reason may be one of the
following:</div> <div>1. An application was not received or
accepted.</div> <div>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of
securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</div>
<div>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue
or issuer.</div> <div>4. The issue was privately placed, in which
case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</div>
<div>Withdrawal may occur if new and material circumstances arise,
the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or for other reasons.</div> </div>

<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</div>
<div>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the
relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</div> <div>P-1: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-2: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-3: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div>
<div>NP: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</div>
<div>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal
obligations that are considered investment grade and are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the
maturity of the obligation.</div> <div>MIG 1:<font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for
refinancing.</font></div> <div>MIG 2:<font> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.</font></div>
<div>MIG 3:<font> This designation
denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div>
<div>SG:<font> This designation denotes
speculative-grade credit quality. Debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection.</font></div>
<div>S&amp;P Global Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> An obligation rated AAA
has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> An obligation rated AA
differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment is very strong.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> An obligation rated A is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font> An
obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.</font></div> <div>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:<font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font></div>
<div>BB:<font> An obligation rated BB is
less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>B:<font> An obligation rated B is
more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s
capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> An obligation rated CCC
is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> An obligation rated C is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> An obligation rated D is in
default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within
five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where
default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>NR:<font> NR indicates no rating has
been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> The ratings from AA to
CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>A-1: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates
that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>A-2: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is
satisfactory.</font></div> <div>A-3: <font>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> <div>B: <font>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing
uncertainties which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>C: <font>A short-term obligation
rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>D: <font>A short-term obligation
rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will
be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action
and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>

<div>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global
Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a
long-term debt rating.</div> <div>SP-1:<font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div>SP-2:<font> Satisfactory capacity to
pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div>SP-3:<font> Speculative capacity to
pay principal and interest.</font></div> <div>Fitch Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> Highest credit quality.
AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
events.</font></div> <div>AA:<font> Very
high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> High credit quality. A
ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher
ratings.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font>
Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this
capacity.</font></div> <div>BB:<font>
Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial
commitments to be met.</font></div> <div>B:<font> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> Substantial credit risk.
CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> Very high levels of credit
risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Exceptionally high levels
of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D
ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability
to default and loss.</div> <div>Note: The modifiers “+”
or “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories below CCC.</div>
<div>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded
market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty
risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to market risk.</div>

<div>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases
on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to
obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short-term” based on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public
finance markets.</div> <div>F1:<font>
Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</font></div>
<div>F2:<font> Good short-term credit
quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>F3:<font> Fair short-term credit
quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Speculative short-term
credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> High short-term default
risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div> <div>RD:<font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div>D:<font> Default.
Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div>
