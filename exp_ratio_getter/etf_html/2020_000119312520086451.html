<p><b>SUPPLEMENTAL PROSPECTUS DATED MARCH 26, 2020 </b></p>
<p><b>SPDR<sup>®</sup> S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> ETF
Trust </b></p> <p><b>(the “Trust”) </b></p>
<p><b>(formerly known as “SPDR Trust, Series 1”) </b></p>
<p><b>(A Unit Investment Trust constituted outside Singapore and organized in the United States) </b></p>
<p>A copy of this Supplemental Prospectus has been lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “<b>Authority</b>”) who takes
no responsibility for its contents. </p> <p>This Supplemental Prospectus is lodged pursuant to Section 298 of the Securities and Futures Act
(Chapter 289 of Singapore) and is supplemental to the prospectus relating to the Trust registered by the Authority on January 17, 2020 (the “<b>Prospectus</b>”). </p>
<p>Terms used in this Supplemental Prospectus will have the same meaning and construction as ascribed to them in the Prospectus. References to
“paragraphs” and “sections” are to the paragraphs and sections of the Prospectus. This Supplemental Prospectus should be read and construed in conjunction with and as one document with the Prospectus and should not be distributed
without the Prospectus. </p> <p><b>Effective immediately, the “Equity Investing Risk” of the
<font>sub-section</font> entitled “Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust” within the section entitled “Summary” on pages 4 and 5 of the Prospectus is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety as
follows: </b></p> <p>“<i>Equity Investing and Market Risk.</i>    An investment in the Trust involves risks similar to
those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices, war, acts of terrorism, the spread of
infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the
Trust and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. </p> <p>An investment in the
Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of
Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of equity securities generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the
Portfolio Securities change from time to time. </p> <p>The financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the
general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the Portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not
result in its elimination from the Portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the Index. Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and
perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or
contraction, and global or </p>

<p>
regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. </p>
<p>An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as <font>COVID-19</font> was
first detected in China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, restrictions on gatherings of people (including closings or limitations on
dining and entertainment establishments, as well as schools and universities), closed businesses (or businesses that are restricted in their operations), closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere,
disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of <font>COVID-19,</font> and other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, individual issuers and capital markets in ways that
cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises caused by the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak may exacerbate other <font>pre-existing</font> political, social and economic risks in certain
countries or globally. The duration of the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak cannot be determined with certainty. The risk of further spreading of <font>COVID-19</font> has led to significant
uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets and disruption to the global economy, the consequences of which are currently unpredictable. Certain of the Trust’s investments are likely to have exposure to businesses that, as a result of <font>COVID-19,</font> experience a slowdown or temporary suspension in business activities. These factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health crisis,
such as the one posed by <font>COVID-19,</font> could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. </p>
<p>Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the
rights of common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated
principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity
securities values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of the Portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. </p>
<p>There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of
dividends by the issuers of Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic conditions.” </p>
