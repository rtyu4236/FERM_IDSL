and Mexico’s largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in
1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for
the trade arrangements among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as

Description. </b>As of September 25, 2018, the MSCI World ex USA Low Size Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI World ex USA Index, which includes large- and mid-capitalization stocks across the
following 22 developed market countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Singapore, Switzerland, and the
U.K. The Underlying Index is constructed by reweighting the constituents of its market capitalization-weighted parent index. At each rebalancing, a factor is applied that operates as a constraint on the weight of individual components of
the Underlying Index – the “constraint factor.” The constraint factor is held constant between each rebalancing. The constraint factor is calculated by reference to the relative weight of each component in the Parent Index and used to

<p><font size="2">
depreciation of individual components between each rebalancing. The Underlying Index is rebalanced semiannually in May and November. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Calculation Methodology.</b> The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant
dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional
investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents.

margins. Like other technology companies, information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights.

<p><font size="2"><b>Energy Sector Risk.</b> The success of companies in the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities
issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among other things: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of
energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and
contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental
entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less
developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other
environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and
could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<i>e.g.</i>, oil and natural gas) and services,
exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and </font></p>

general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy
markets or in the global economy. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”
