performance of companies that S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., deems to be part of the utilities sector of the economy. The Underlying Index is a subset of the
S&amp;P Global 1200, which is designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single
issuer (as determined by SPDJI) to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of

the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at
quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.5%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews,
the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In
implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI considers two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where more than 20% of all voting shares in a subsidiary are controlled by the same issuer control group. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">As of January 29, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the utilities industry or sector. The
components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of January 29, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries or regions: Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the
