Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non‑corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. </div> <div>The second paragraph in the section of the Prospectus entitled “Taxes on Distributions” is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following for HEZU: </div> <div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund.
