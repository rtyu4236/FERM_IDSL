<div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF
(the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization emerging market companies that have a favorable environmental, social and governance rating while
applying extensive screens for company involvement in controversial activities.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the
fees and expenses that you will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”)
(the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as
brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
investments results of the MSCI Emerging Markets Choice ESG Screened 5% Issuer Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or
“MSCI”). The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index designed to reflect the equity performance of large- and mid-capitalization emerging market companies with
favorable environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) ratings (as determined by MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”)) while applying extensive screens, including removing fossil fuel
exposure. MSCI begins with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (the “Parent Index”) and selects companies with favorable ESG ratings while excluding securities of companies involved in adult entertainment,
alcohol, gambling, tobacco, genetic engineering, controversial weapons, nuclear weapons, civilian firearms, conventional weapons, palm oil, private prisons, predatory lending, and nuclear power based on revenue or
percentage of revenue thresholds for certain categories (<font>e.g.</font> $500 million or 50%) and categorical exclusions for others (<font>e.g.</font> nuclear weapons).</div>
<div>MSCI ESG Research rates the ESG
characteristics of securities on a scale</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>of “CCC” (lowest) to “AAA”
(highest). MSCI ESG Research determines the ESG ratings by evaluating the company's risks and opportunities and using a sector-specific ESG Key Issues (“Key Issues”) (<font>e.g.</font>, carbon emissions) selection and weighting model. Each company is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the most desirable, for each applicable Key Issue before being
provided an ESG rating based on average Key Issue score. ESG ratings are calculated in comparison to a company's sector peers, and securities in one sector may have a lower average ESG rating than securities in
another sector. Only securities of companies with an ESG rating of “BBB” or higher are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>MSCI screens companies with
involvement in fossil fuels by excluding any company in the energy sector as per GICS methodology and all companies with an industry tie to fossil fuels such as thermal coal, oil and gas—in particular, reserve
ownership, related revenues and power generation. Companies that meet the fossil fuel involvement screen but that derive more than 50% of revenues from alternative energy and do not have an industry tie to thermal
coal or oil sands or have fossil fuel reserves used most likely for energy applications, as determined by the Index Provider, will be added back. Additionally, MSCI excludes companies involved in very serious business
controversies. MSCI ESG Research defines a controversy as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Each
controversy case is assessed for the severity of its impact on society. The Underlying Index also applies a 5% cap on any individual issuer to minimize constituent concentration.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes large-
and mid-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of May 12, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary, financials and
information technology industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. The Underlying Index is reviewed quarterly to coincide with the semi-annual and quarterly review of
the Parent Index.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings),
fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying
Index.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at
least 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index
(<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying
Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by
MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market
value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this
limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any
industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
lose all or part of your investment in the</div>

<div>
<div>Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that
of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield,
total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial
market or other asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</font></div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may
invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the
Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage
in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
respect to the Fund and no other</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Authorized Participant is able to step forward to
create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded
funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or
asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector
Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable
income, consumer preferences, social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the
U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and
without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks,
agents and depositories.</font></div>

<div></div>
<p> 
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.
Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the
Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common
stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>ESG Investment Strategy Risk. <font>The Fund’s ESG investment strategy limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other
funds that do not have an ESG focus. The Fund’s ESG investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds
screened for ESG standards. In addition, companies selected by the Index</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Provider may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG
characteristics.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is
limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent
years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the
Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the
specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.
Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
period of time or at all, which may</font></div>

<div></div>
<p> 
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme
volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or
cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector
Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and
may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the information technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or
regulatory action. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived
vulnerabilities in their products or services.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies
Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more
mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance
of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization</font></div>

</div>

</div>
<hr/>
<div></div>
<p> 
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>companies may be less stable and more susceptible
to adverse developments. In addition, the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading
Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities
exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those
experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on
the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or
nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small
number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to
</font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>limited to, human error, processing and
communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these
operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or
be re-nationalized.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on
the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China<font>. </font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed securities, subject the Fund to risks specific to China. Investments in certain Hong Kong-listed
securities may also subject the Fund to exposure to Chinese companies. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates
significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of</font></div>

<div>
<div>economic and market practices and has expanded the
sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly
available information and/or political and social instability. Internal social unrest or confrontations with other neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt
economic development in China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. China has experienced security concerns, such
as terrorism and strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses
to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the
Fund invests. Incidents involving China's or the region's security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's investments. Export growth continues to be a
major driver of China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions or a
trade war between China and the U.S., or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China's key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese
economy. Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting
standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be significant
obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select
investments based on investor protection considerations.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging
Markets<font>.</font><font> The Fund's investments in emerging market issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets.
Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same
degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable
or complete. Emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information
necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection
considerations.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to</font></div>

<div></div>
<p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Russia. In addition, investing in Russian
securities involves risks associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody
in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S., Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities.
Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing
restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government or Russian companies, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Saudi
Arabia<font>.</font><font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) to invest in Saudi Arabian issuers is new and untested. Such ability could be restricted or revoked by the Saudi
Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could materialize due to foreign ownership in such securities. The economy of Saudi Arabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained decrease in petroleum
prices could have a negative impact on all aspects of the economy. Investments in securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involves risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed
countries that may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government
intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result
of religious,</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. There remains
the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no assurance of political stability in Saudi Arabia.</div>
<div>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.<font> There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in equity securities in the Saudi Arabian market. The Fund generally expects to conduct its transactions
in a manner in which the Fund would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund, which may have an adverse
impact on the prices, quantity or timing of Fund transactions.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return
the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with
cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a
country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the
Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the</font></div>

<div>Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the
Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a
security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested
cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of
capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened
during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK
INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE
HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by
the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons.
In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized
Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the
Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party
service providers.</font></div>

<div>Investment Adviser.<font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each
Portfolio Manager supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Aguirre, Ms. Hsui, Mr. Mason, Mr. Savage and Ms. Whitelaw have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since inception (2020).</font></div>
<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual
shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or
less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing
to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”),
in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/>
