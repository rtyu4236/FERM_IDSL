<div>The iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of 30 of the largest emerging market equities in the infrastructure industry.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through July 31, 2022. The contractual waiver
may be terminated prior to July 31, 2022 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Example. <font>This Example is
intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would
be:</font></div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 25% of the average value
of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal Investment
Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results
of the S&amp;P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which is designed to track the performance of 30 of the
largest publicly listed companies in the infrastructure industry in emerging markets, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). The Underlying Index includes three distinct
infrastructure sub-sectors: energy, transportation and utilities. As of March 31, 2019, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries or regions: Brazil, Chilé,</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>China, Greece, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia (Russian Federation), South Korea and
Thailand.<font> </font>Based on the methodology, constituents must have a minimum total market capitalization as of the rebalancing reference date of $250 million and a minimum float adjusted market capitalization as of the
rebalancing reference date of $200 million. The Underlying Index may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies. As of March 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the energy,
industrials, infrastructure and utilities industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax</div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA uses a representative
sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an
applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability
and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as
well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>(including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry. Because all of the securities included in the Underlying Index are issued by utility, energy and transportation infrastructure companies, the Fund will be concentrated in the
infrastructure industry.</font></div> <div>Summary of Principal
Risks</div> <div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part
of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of the Prospectus)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other
Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the
Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as
the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and
depositories.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk.<font> The market value of securities in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among others, changes in energy prices, energy supply and demand, government</font></div> </div>

<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>regulations and energy conservation efforts.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for
environmental damage or product liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</div>
<div>Infrastructure Industry Risk.<font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital
construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. The stock prices of transportation companies
may be affected by supply and demand for their specific product, government regulation, world events and economic conditions. The profitability of energy companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.
Utilities companies face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins, and the rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization
companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is
open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a
result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries.
Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China<font>.
</font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed securities, subject the Fund to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic,
political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic
and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of
publicly available information and/or political and social instability. Internal social unrest or confrontations with other neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in
China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international
relations.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Incidents involving China's or the region's security may cause uncertainty in
Chinese markets and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional
tariffs or other trade barriers, including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., or a downturn in any of the economies of China's key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> The Fund's investments in emerging market issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed
markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, less
reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks
associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S.,
Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. These and future
sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may adversely affect Russia’s economy and the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Thematic Investing Risk.<font> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>identification of themes and sub-themes and its performance may suffer if such
themes or sub-themes are not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or
sub-themes. Performance may also be impacted by the inclusion of non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures intended.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing
regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying</font></div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Index does not. INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN
EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Deregulation, however, may subject utility companies to greater competition and may reduce their profitability.
Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in
low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during
time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing
services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> <div type="Block"> </div> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

performed on a calendar year basis and provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Both assume that all dividends and distributions have been reinvested in the Fund. Past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Supplemental information about the Fund’s performance is shown under the heading <font>Total Return Information</font> in the
<font>Supplemental Information</font> section of the Prospectus. If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees during certain periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower.</div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each
day.</div> <div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
