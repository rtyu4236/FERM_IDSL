Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.50%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is reasonable evidence of common control. The Underlying Index includes large-, <div>mid-</div> and small-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of April 30, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer services industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </div></div> <div><div><div><div>Prior to September 20, 2021, the last paragraph of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” for the Fund is the following, instead of the current last paragraph of the section: </div></div></div></div> <div><div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by SPDJI, which is independent of the Fund and BFA.

The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer (as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)) to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.50%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping </div></div></ix:nonnumeric></ix:continuation> <div> </div> <hr/><ix:continuation continuedat="TextSelectionAppend_3892600_11"><ix:continuation continuedat="TextSelectionAppend_3892596_1"> <div><div> methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is reasonable evidence of common control.

Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.50%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is reasonable evidence of common control. </span></p> <p><span><span>Dow Jones U.S. Financials Capped Index </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Number of Components: approximately 232</span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Index Description.</span> The Dow Jones U.S. Financials Capped Index is a subset of the Dow Jones U.S. Index.
