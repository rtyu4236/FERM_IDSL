Trust, Series 1<br/>(A Unit Investment Trust)</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENT DATED
NOVEMBER 22, 2006<br/>TO PROSPECTUS DATED JANUARY 27,
2006</p>
<p>This Supplement dated November  22,
2006 modifies the prospectus for the SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the
‘‘Trust’’) dated January  27,
2006 and all other supplements thereto.</p>
<p>The Trustee has
changed the method of computing the Adjustment Amount to the Trustee
Fee such that all income earned with respect to cash held for the
benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee’s Fee. In
addition, during the period from December  1,  2006 through
December  31,  2006, the Trustee will apply incremental
cash balance credits of approximately $5.9  million (or less than
$0.0005 per share per day, assuming 470  million shares
outstanding) against its base fee. Such incremental credit will be
calculated and applied on a daily basis for such
period.</p>
