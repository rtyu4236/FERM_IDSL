These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. </div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds whose underlying index </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may result in divergence of the Fund’s overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of the Underlying Index. </div> <div>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria and data used in such evaluation. </div> <div>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over time. </div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span> Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </div> <div>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. </div> <div><span>Style Factors Risk. </span>Each of the five equity style factors (<span>i.e.</span>, momentum, quality, value, low volatility and size) that determine the weight of each component security in the Underlying Index has characteristics that may cause the Fund to underperform the Parent Index or the market as a whole. </div> <div><span>Momentum Factor Risk</span>. Stocks that previously exhibited relatively high momentum characteristics may not experience positive momentum in the future or may experience more volatility than the market as a whole. The Index Provider may be unsuccessful in creating an index that emphasizes an allocation to momentum securities. In addition, there </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> may be periods when the momentum style of investing is out of favor and the investment performance of the Fund may suffer. </div> <div><span>Quality Factor Risk</span>. The Fund invests in stocks that are deemed by the Index Provider to be of high quality based on a number of attributes, but there is no guarantee that the past performance of these stocks or their issuers will continue. The Index Provider may be unsuccessful in creating an index that emphasizes an allocation to quality stocks. The measures of a stock’s quality as identified by the Index Provider can be adversely affected by market, regulatory, political, environmental and other developments. The price of a stock also may be affected by attributes other than those considered by the Index Provider. The degree to which these attributes may affect a stock’s performance can be difficult to predict. </div> <div><span>Value Factor Risk</span>. Value securities are those issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued. Value securities, particularly securities of a company that appear to trade at a significant discount to the company’s intrinsic value, may fail to appreciate for long periods of time and may never realize their full potential value. The Index Provider may be unsuccessful in creating an index that emphasizes an allocation to undervalued securities. Value securities have generally performed better than nonvalue securities during periods of economic recovery, although there is no assurance that they will continue to do so. There may be periods where value securities go out of favor, thus causing the Fund’s performance to suffer. </div> <div><span>Low Volatility Factor Risk</span>. The value of the securities in the Fund’s portfolio may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, including due to factors affecting markets generally or particular industries. This volatility may affect the Fund’s NAV. Securities in the Fund’s portfolio may be subject to price volatility, and the prices may not be any less volatile than the market as a whole, and could be more volatile. Events or financial circumstances affecting individual securities or sectors may increase the volatility of the Fund. </div> <div><span>Low Size Factor Risk</span>. The stocks of low size companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies, and therefore the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by relatively larger companies. Stock prices of low size companies are more vulnerable to adverse business and economic developments. Securities of low size companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, low size companies may be less financially stable than relatively larger, more established companies and may </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Low size companies also may have less diverse product lines than those of larger companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products. </div> <div><span></span><span><span><span>Changes to the Fund’s Other Risks</span> </span></span></div> <div>Changes to the following disclosures from the section entitled “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” of the Prospectus: </div> <div>The section entitled “Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk” on page 19, “Financials Sector Risk” on pages 21‑22 and “Materials Sector Risk” on page 23 is deleted in its entirety. </div> <div>The following disclosures are added to the section entitled “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” of the Prospectus: </div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span> Many Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span>The success of companies in the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources, exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (e.g., oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. </div> <div>In the context of the COVID‑19 outbreak and disputes among oil‑producing countries regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month WTI crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by other countries, as well as the extent and duration of the </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund. </div> <div><span>Mid‑Capitalization Companies Risk.</span> Stock prices of mid‑capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid‑capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid‑capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid‑capitalization companies. In addition, mid‑capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. </div> <div><span></span><span><span><span>Changes to the Fund’s “Index Provider”</span> </span></span></div> <div>The section entitled “Index Provider” on page 39 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </div> <div>STOXX Ltd.<sup>®</sup> is a global provider of over 6,000 strictly rules-based and transparent indices.

The STOXX global equity universe includes all common stocks and equities with similar characteristics from financial markets that provide real-time and historical component and currency pricing. The Global TMI is the fraction of the STOXX investable universe listed on eligible stock exchanges. The STOXX Country Total Market indexes form the basis for all regional STOXX Total Market indexes (each, a “Regional TMI”). Each STOXX Country Total Market index aims to represent a broad market and covers at least 95 percent of the free float market capitalization of the respective country’s investable universe. Each of the STOXX Total Market Indexes is derived from its respective Regional TMI(s). </div> <div>STOXX World Equity Indexes </div> <div>The STOXX World Equity Indexes includes a number of regional, country and sector equity indexes which are modular components of the STOXX World AC All Cap Index (AC stand for All Countries). The STOXX World AC All Cap Index aims to provide a broad universe that includes all investable stocks, ADR’s and GDR’s from all developed and </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> emerging markets in the world. Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of approximately the top 70 percent, 85 percent and 95 percent of each respective countries’ free float-adjusted market capitalization. The universe for all countries besides China, is the combination of the respective STOXX Country Total Market Index, the respective country’s constituents in the STOXX GCC Total Market Index (a Regional TMI that aims to represent the Gulf Cooperation Council countries market, which consists of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) and the respective country’s constituents of the STOXX World DR Index (a free-float market capitalization-weighted index of depositary receipts whose universe includes ADRs and GDRs that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or the London Stock Exchange). For China the universe is the aggregate of the STOXX China Total Market Index, the STOXX China A Total Market Index, the STOXX China P‑Chip Total Market Index, and the China constituents in the STOXX Global DR Index. </div> <div>STOXX Global Equity Factor Index </div> <div><span></span><span><span><span>Number of Components: approximately 689</span> </span></span></div> <div><span>Index Description.</span> The STOXX Global Equity Factor Index (the “Underlying Index”) is a subset of the STOXX World AC Index (the “Parent Index”), which is a free float market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance of large- and mid‑capitalization companies from developed and emerging markets. Large- and mid‑capitalization companies, as calculated by the Index Provider, represent approximately the top 85% of the investable market capitalization of each developed and emerging market country included in the Parent Index, as defined by STOXX. Free float market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total market capitalization of a security by a free float factor, as determined by the Index Provider, to reflect the market capitalization of the number of shares available in the market (rather than that of the total number of shares outstanding). The Underlying Index is composed of small-capitalization equity securities from the Parent Index that are selected and weighted using an optimization process designed to maximize exposure to five target factors: momentum, quality, value, low volatility and size. The Underlying Index also seeks to mitigate exposure to unintended systematic exposures, limit turnover and maintain a level of risk similar to that of the Parent Index. </div> <div><span>Index Methodology.</span> The momentum score is calculated from the following signals: price momentum, earnings momentum and earnings </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> announcement drift (<span>i.e.</span>, the difference between a stock’s performance on and immediately following an earnings announcement date). </div> <div>The quality score is calculated from the following signals: gross profitability, share dilution, accruals, changes in net operating assets, carbon emissions intensity and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction targets. Carbon emissions intensity is based on the issuer’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (<span>i.e.</span>, direct emissions from sources that an issuer owns or controls and indirect emissions from the issuer’s purchase of energy) relative to peers in its Industry Classification Benchmark (“ICB”) Supersector, as reported by Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”). The GHG targets signal is based on the robustness of an issuer’s GHG reduction targets, including whether they are part of the Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) framework; this is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG ratings data and SBTi data. </div> <div>The value score is calculated from the following signals: current book value‑to‑price ratio, dividend yield (<span>i.e.</span>, 12‑month trailing dividend divided by total market capitalization), earnings yield (<span>i.e.</span>, 12-month net income divided by total market capitalization), cash flow yield (<span>i.e.</span>, 12‑month cash flow divided by total market capitalization) and time series normalized cash flow yield over the previous 36 months. </div> <div>The low volatility score is based on prior 12‑month volatility, as calculated by the Index Provider. </div> <div>The size score seeks to measure an issuer’s market capitalization relative to other companies in the Parent Index. </div> <div>The Index Provider derives a composite score based on a combination of the five factors at the following weights: momentum, 27%; quality, 36%; value, 27%; low volatility, 5%; and size, 5%. The composite score is an input to the optimization process through which the Index Provider selects securities from the Parent Index and assigns weights. </div> <div>The optimization process seeks to maximize the overall exposure to the five factors while applying certain constraints, which include the following: </div> <div> </div>
