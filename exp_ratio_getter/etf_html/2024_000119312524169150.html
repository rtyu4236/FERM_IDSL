Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>NYSE Arca, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE Arca</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may be </span><span>different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency </span><span>purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or </span><span>other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its </span><span>portfolio.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>5G Next Gen Connectivity Risk.</span><span> 5G and next generation connections refer to the </span><span>nascent technologies forming the foundation of wireless networks that are being </span><span>developed globally. These technologies seek to enable increases in network capacities, </span><span>speeds, and management capabilities and seek to enable the use of millions of devices </span><span>simultaneously. In the future, 5G networks aim to provide digital infrastructure links </span><span>between consumer devices, sensors, and other users. Companies across a wide variety </span><span>of industries, primarily in the technology sector, are exploring the possible applications </span><span>of 5G and next generation technologies. The Fund’s holdings may include equity </span><span>securities of operating companies that focus on or have exposure to a wide variety of </span><span>industries, and the economic success of certain of these companies may not be </span><span>significantly tied to such technologies. Smaller 5G and next generation connectivity </span><span>companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. </span><span>These companies may face intense competition and potentially rapid product </span><span>obsolescence.</span></div> <div><span>These companies may also store sensitive consumer information and could be the </span><span>target of cybersecurity attacks and other types of theft, which could have a negative </span><span>impact on these companies. These companies may be subject to additional regulatory </span><span>oversight and may be adversely impacted by government regulations. These </span><span>companies may depend on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected </span><span>by the impairment of those rights. These companies could also be negatively impacted </span><span>by disruptions in service caused by hardware or software failure, or by interruptions or </span><span>delays in service by third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance </span><span>providers. 5G and next generation connectivity companies, especially smaller </span><span>companies, may be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on </span><span>technology. The customers and suppliers of these companies may be concentrated in a </span><span>particular country, region or industry and adverse events occurring in those countries, </span><span>regions or industries could have a negative impact on these companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span> relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> <div><span>Cloud-based Computing and Data Storage Risk.</span><span> Companies involved in, or exposed </span><span>to, cloud-based computing and data storage-related businesses may have limited </span><span>product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. These companies face intense </span><span>competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend on </span><span>retaining and growing the consumer base of their respective products and services. </span><span>These companies may not be exclusively or substantially exposed to cloud-based </span><span>computing and data storage-related businesses (as determined by the Index Provider), </span><span>but may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to the market and business risks of other </span><span>companies, industries or sectors, and the Fund may be adversely affected by negative </span><span>developments impacting those other companies, industries or sectors. These </span><span>companies may depend on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected </span><span>by loss or impairment of those rights. There can be no assurance that companies </span><span>involved in cloud-based computing and data storage will be able to successfully protect </span><span>their intellectual property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology, or that </span><span>competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior.</span></div> <div><span>Cloud-based computing and data storage companies also depend on a number of third </span><span>parties to provide services to data centers, which, if interrupted, may impact products </span><span>and services. These companies are also potential targets for cyberattacks, which may </span><span>have a materially adverse impact on the performance of these companies. These </span><span>companies may also be affected by prolonged power outages or shortages, increased </span><span>costs of energy, or general lack of availability of electrical sources. Cloud-based </span><span>computing and data storage companies, especially smaller companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than companies not in the technology sector. </span></div> <div><span>Legal and regulatory changes, particularly related to information privacy and data </span><span>protection, may impact the products or services of cloud-based computing and data </span><span>storage companies. Cloud-based computing may face increasing regulatory scrutiny </span><span>and legal liability, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the </span><span>growth of companies that develop or use this technology. Similarly, the collection of </span><span>data from consumers and other sources, and storage of that data, may face increased </span><span>scrutiny as regulators consider how data may be collected, stored, safeguarded and </span><span>used. In the event of a data breach or a similar incident, cloud-based computing and </span><span>data storage companies may face legal liability. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk.</span><span> Because the Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, </span><span>investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund </span><span>invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on </span><span>repatriation of such currency, even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that </span><span>market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly </span><span>and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without </span><span>warning.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</span><span> To the extent that the underlying securities or </span><span>other instruments held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets </span><span>that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is </span><span>open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying </span><span>security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the Fund’s quote </span><span>from the closed foreign market).</span><span> </span><span>The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is </span><span>likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities or other </span><span>instruments trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed </span><span>for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to </span><span>the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.</span><span> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are </span><span>subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, </span><span>including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused </span><span>by economic and political developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, </span><span>the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed </span><span>below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Government intervention in issuers' operations or structure;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>A lack of market liquidity and market efficiency;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Greater securities price volatility;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Less availability of public information about issuers;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Limitations on foreign ownership of securities;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of withholding or other taxes;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of the funds or other assets of the </span><span>Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Higher transaction and custody costs and delays in settlement procedures;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Lower levels of regulation of the securities markets;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Weaker accounting, disclosure and reporting requirements and the risk of being </span><span>delisted from U.S. exchanges; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Legal principles relating to corporate governance, directors’ fiduciary duties and </span><span>liabilities and stockholders’ rights in markets in which the Fund invests may differ </span><span>from or may not be as extensive or protective as those that apply in the U.S.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Withholding Tax Reclaims Risk</span><span>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on </span><span>dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where </span><span>such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund will receive a </span><span>withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such </span><span>countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous </span><span>assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund generally includes accruals </span><span>for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential </span><span>impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially </span><span>decreases, for example due to a change in tax regulation or approach, accruals in the </span><span>Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will </span><span>adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written </span><span>down will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they </span><span>were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund </span><span>that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is </span><span>successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who </span><span>sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong </span><span>Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The </span><span>Chinese economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and social </span><span>instability.</span></div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese </span><span>companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and </span><span>potentially other sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can </span><span>intervene in their operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of </span><span>the Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and </span><span>services, supply chain diversification, institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other </span><span>trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and </span><span>the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any </span><span>of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Chinese economy and companies in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese </span><span>companies (which may change from time to time) are directly or indirectly subject to </span><span>economic or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments due to </span><span>national security, human rights or other concerns of such government. For example, </span><span>certain foreign technology companies are subject to U.S. export controls as those </span><span>companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. The U.S. also bans imports of </span><span>goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain Chinese companies due to </span><span>concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have unanticipated and adverse </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action that targets Chinese </span><span>financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay </span><span>settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index may include companies </span><span>that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not investment restrictions) </span><span>imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these restrictions do not include </span><span>restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected to invest in such </span><span>companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of the Underlying </span><span>Index.</span></div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> <div><span>Security Risk. China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. China has a complex territorial dispute </span><span>regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has pledged to take control of Taiwan, </span><span>including by force if necessary. The Chinese military has conducted military drills </span><span>around Taiwan in connection with China’s claim to Taiwan. Taiwan-based companies </span><span>and individuals are significant investors in China. These tensions between Taiwan and </span><span>China may adversely affect the Chinese economy. Additionally, China is alleged to have </span><span>participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </span><span>governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained </span><span>international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or </span><span>cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s </span><span>economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> <div><span>Chinese Equity Markets. The Fund invests in Chinese securities, including H-shares, </span><span>A-shares, B-shares, Red-Chips and/or P-Chips. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares </span><span>by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a </span><span>“</span><span>back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> through Red-Chips </span><span>or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic </span><span>reform. </span><span>“</span><span>Back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues </span><span>Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international </span><span>capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the political and economic policies in </span><span>China. </span></div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region (</span><span>“</span><span>SAR</span><span>”</span><span>) of the People's Republic of China (</span><span>“</span><span>PRC</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to </span><span>maintain the current capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June </span><span>30, 2047, the continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is </span><span>dependent on the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China </span><span>as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, </span><span>legal and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even </span><span>further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, </span><span>this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese </span><span>markets. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to </span><span>(or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of </span><span>the Hong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will </span><span>continue or what effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system </span><span>would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in </span><span>U.S. dollars, the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese companies, including Chinese </span><span>companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with </span><span>securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting </span><span>standards and auditor oversight requirements, which would significantly decrease the </span><span>liquidity and value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, </span><span>and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed </span><span>and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Cloud Computing Companies.</span><span> Cloud computing companies </span><span>include companies that provide remote computation, software, data access and </span><span>storage services. The risks related to investing in such companies include disruption in </span><span>service caused by hardware or software failure, interruptions or delays in service by </span><span>third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance providers, security breaches </span><span>involving certain private, sensitive, proprietary and confidential information managed </span><span>and transmitted by cloud computing companies, and privacy concerns and laws, </span><span>evolving Internet regulation and other foreign or domestic regulations that may limit or </span><span>otherwise affect the operations of such companies. Also, the business models </span><span>employed by the companies in the cloud computing industry may not prove to be </span><span>successful.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization </span><span>companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than </span><span>those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic </span><span>developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, </span><span>making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization </span><span>companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies </span><span>and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies </span><span>more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization</span><span> companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of </span><span>mid- or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse </span><span>developments concerning their products.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector may face increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Thematic Investing Risk.</span><span> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification </span><span>of securities for inclusion in the Underlying Index that reflect themes and sub-themes, </span><span>and its performance may suffer if such securities are not correctly identified or if a </span><span>theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer </span><span>if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of </span><span>such themes or sub-themes. Performance may also be impacted by the inclusion of </span><span>non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the </span><span>Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures intended.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest </span><span>received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements </span><span>to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </span><span>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, </span><span>changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be </span><span>heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY </span><span>EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX </span><span>ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets </span><span>denominated in non-U.S. currencies is translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing </span><span>market rates. This translation may result in a difference between the prices used to </span><span>calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on </span><span>days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, </span><span>or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the </span><span>securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability </span><span>to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing </span><span>services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk.</span><span> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in </span><span>the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and </span><span>other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also </span><span>cause the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to </span><span>satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Communication Services Sector Risk.</span><span> The communication services sector consists </span><span>of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the </span><span>media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication </span><span>services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry </span><span>group encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, </span><span>gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review </span><span>websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services </span><span>sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, </span><span>government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products and services </span><span>due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, </span><span>shifting demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can </span><span>drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while </span><span>all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could </span><span>have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to </span><span>extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental </span><span>regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the </span><span>enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the </span><span>area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and </span><span>unpredictable. The communications services industry can also be significantly affected </span><span>by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative </span><span>technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and </span><span>standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and </span><span>development of new products, lack of standardization or compatibility with existing </span><span>technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the </span><span>need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications </span><span>companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to </span><span>obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing </span><span>and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide </span><span>an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to </span><span>market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation </span><span>of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative </span><span>effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may </span><span>be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive </span><span>challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic joint ventures </span><span>with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. </span><span>competitors.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by </span><span>several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and </span><span>services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies </span><span>in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising </span><span>spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. </span><span>During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, </span><span>media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and </span><span>depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may </span><span>make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may </span><span>compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be </span><span>subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care </span><span>of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets </span><span>are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the U.K.'s economy may be affected by global economic, industrial and </span><span>financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU </span><span>regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency </span><span>of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its </span><span>sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a </span><span>significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their </span><span>trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced </span><span>volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or </span><span>government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. If the Fund is </span><span>forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable </span><span>conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a </span><span>loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other </span><span>circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other </span><span>market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the </span><span>Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and </span><span>contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if </span><span>the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when </span><span>shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to </span><span>meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the </span><span>Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the </span><span>Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying </span><span>securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Companies that invest in real estate (</span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate </span><span>Companies</span><span>”</span><span>), such as REITs,</span><span> </span><span>real estate holding and operating companies, or real </span><span>estate management or development companies, expose investors to the risks of </span><span>owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in </span><span>which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly </span><span>sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments and is </span><span>characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate </span><span>Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which </span><span>increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and </span><span>could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher </span><span>costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate </span><span>Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity</span><span> </span><span>and could </span><span>decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, </span><span>to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its </span><span>shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk. </span><span>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changes in consumer preferences and values, increasing vacancies </span><span>or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic </span><span>developments and changes in tax law.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired.

This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund.

For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, based on the returns earned </span><span>on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as collateral </span><span>for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>IDAT.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE </span><span>Arca.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair </span><span>value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the </span><span>relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is </span><span>designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets </span><span>following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of </span><span>the Fund’s pricing time.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use </span><span>foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out </span><span>pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>38</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

After market close on August 12, 2024, the Fund will cease the creation and redemption of Creation Units. </span><span>Trading in the Fund will be halted prior to market open on August 13, 2024. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently </span><span>scheduled to be sent to Fund shareholders on or around August 15, 2024 (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidation Date</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>While the Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio, which is anticipated to commence prior to August 12, 2024, the </span><span>Fund will hold cash and securities that will not be consistent with its investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur </span><span>higher tracking error than is typical for the Fund. Furthermore, the Trust cannot assure that there will be a trading market for </span><span>Fund shares between market close on August 12, 2024 and the Liquidation Date because Fund shares will not be traded on </span><span>the primary listing exchange identified in the Prospectus for the Fund (the </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) during that period.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund on its Listing Exchange until market close on August 12, 2024 and may incur </span><span>the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. As of the Liquidation Date, shares </span><span>of the Fund will be individually redeemed. If you hold Fund shares on the Liquidation Date, the Fund will automatically </span><span>redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value of the Fund as of the close of business on August 12, 2024, which </span><span>will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.</span></div> <div><span>If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A </span><span>sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the Liquidation Date will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal </span><span>income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income </span><span>or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by </span><span>you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss, depending on your tax basis. </span><span>Please consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>If you have any questions, please call 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</span></div> <div><span>iShares</span><span>®</span><span> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary </span><span>markets. Shares of each Fund may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the </span><span>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </span><span>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall </span><span>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </span><span>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each of the iShares Breakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares Core MSCI International </span><span>Developed Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares </span><span>Exponential Technologies ETF, iShares Future Cloud 5G and Tech, iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF, </span><span>iShares Global Equity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon </span><span>Target ETF, iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares MSCI China A ETF, iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF, </span><span>iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF, iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual Work </span><span>and Life Multisector ETF seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its </span><span>relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio </span><span>will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </span><span>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares Breakthrough Environmental </span><span>Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares Exponential </span><span>Technologies ETF, iShares Future Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global </span><span>Equity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares MSCI China A ETF, iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector </span><span>ETF, iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector ETF, along with certain other iShares </span><span>funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New York Mellon (</span><span>“</span><span>BNY</span><span>”</span><span>), which serves as administrative </span><span>agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be used for temporary or emergency purposes, </span><span>including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</span></div> <div><span>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) published </span><span>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease </span><span>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</span></div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific </span><span>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract </span><span>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC </span><span>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon </span><span>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures </span><span>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </span><span>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and </span><span>delivery of the underlying currency. Each Fund does not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of </span><span>hedging against declines in the value of each Fund's assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter </span><span>into non-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to </span><span>protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts </span><span>for speculative purposes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks </span><span>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </span><span>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S.</span><span> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </span><span>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of </span><span>the Fund's return with the performance of the Underlying Index and may lower a Fund’s return. A Fund could experience </span><span>losses if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if </span><span>it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction </span><span>costs, including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Diversification Status.</span><span>  </span><span>The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

With </span><span>respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 </span><span>Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval. However, while </span><span>the iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF is classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified,</span><span>”</span><span> under applicable no-action relief from the SEC </span><span>staff, the fund may become non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market </span><span>capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of its Underlying Index and such a change does not require </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span> </span><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified</span><span>”</span><span> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </span><span>invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </span><span>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </span><span>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that </span><span>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </span><span>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue </span><span>Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </span><span>the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution </span><span>requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment </span><span>flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</span></div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </span><span>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </span><span>of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures </span><span>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </span><span>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing </span><span>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the </span><span>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives </span><span>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market </span><span>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </span><span>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge </span><span>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </span><span>securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options </span><span>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the </span><span>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they </span><span>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be </span><span>structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the Fund exceeds one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events, </span><span>including but not limited to corporate actions, could lead the Fund to lend securities that are trading at a premium due to </span><span>increased demand, or to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a Fund were to lend out securities that are subject to a corporate action and commit to the borrower a particular </span><span>election as determined by the Funds’ investment adviser, the benefit the Fund would receive in respect of committing to such </span><span>election may or may not be less than the benefit the Fund would have received from making a different election in such </span><span>corporate action. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay </span><span>in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </span><span>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </span><span>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </span><span>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </span><span>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </span><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund intends to purchase publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a </span><span>Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American Depositary </span><span>Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>ADRs</span><span>”</span><span>), Global Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>GDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) and European Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>EDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>depositary </span><span>receipts</span><span>”</span><span>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying </span><span>securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their </span><span>underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying </span><span>securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, are receipts </span><span>issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic </span><span>underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international </span><span>basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued in </span><span>bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are </span><span>designed for use throughout the world.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may </span><span>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to </span><span>additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the </span><span>depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency </span><span>risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, </span><span>generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the </span><span>shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</span></div> <div><span>Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing </span><span>in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of </span><span>expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, </span><span>which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.</span><span> issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may </span><span>differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of </span><span>inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </span><span>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its </span><span>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CFTC Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </span><span>investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </span><span>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a </span><span>vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds.

BFA may not have transparency into the holdings of these </span><span>underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a </span><span>no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would </span><span>otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> until </span><span>six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by </span><span>underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this </span><span>no-action relief.

Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other </span><span>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </span><span>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </span><span>of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </span><span>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </span><span>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </span><span>“</span><span>senior securities</span><span>”</span><span> under Section 18 of the </span><span>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits open-end funds, </span><span>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </span><span>“</span><span>senior security,</span><span>”</span><span> other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement </span><span>to maintain 300% </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span>). </span></div> <div><span>Under Rule 18f-4, </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Transactions</span><span>”</span><span> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </span><span>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing, </span><span>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </span><span>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise; </span><span>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</span><span> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </span><span>under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>TBA</span><span>”</span><span>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </span><span>physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </span><span>“</span><span>Delayed-Settlement </span><span>Securities Provision</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions.

The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </span><span>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </span><span>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </span><span>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund, should it decide to utilize them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, </span><span>but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal </span><span>uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with </span><span>a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter </span><span>maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate </span><span>than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the </span><span>counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt </span><span>securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would </span><span>be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </span><span>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </span><span>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </span><span>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </span><span>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required </span><span>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </span><span>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the </span><span>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </span><span>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </span><span>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </span><span>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </span><span>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment </span><span>companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one </span><span>investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s </span><span>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest </span><span>can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which </span><span>would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of </span><span>money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund </span><span>Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment </span><span>companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money </span><span>market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally </span><span>short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised </span><span>by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (</span><span>“</span><span>CDs</span><span>”</span><span>), bankers’ </span><span>acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar </span><span>institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's</span><span>®</span><span> Investors Service, Inc., </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by </span><span>Fitch Ratings, Inc., or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>S&amp;P Global </span><span>Ratings</span><span>”</span><span>), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable </span><span>deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are </span><span>time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </span><span>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </span><span>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The </span><span>use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with </span><span>ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </span><span>underlying assets.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Stocks.</span><span>  </span><span>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or </span><span>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </span><span>“</span><span>track</span><span>”</span><span> the performance of such business unit or division. The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectuses, provided they are consistent with each Fund's </span><span>investment objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in </span><span>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </span><span>particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Cloud-based Computing and Data Storage Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Companies involved in, or exposed to, cloud-based computing and data </span><span>storage-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. These companies face </span><span>intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend on retaining and growing the consumer </span><span>base of their respective products and services. Many companies involved in, or exposed to, cloud-based computing and data </span><span>storage-related businesses (as determined by the Index Provider) may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to the market and </span><span>business risks of other industries or sectors, and the Fund may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting </span><span>those companies, industries or sectors. These companies may depend on intellectual property rights and may be adversely </span><span>affected by loss or impairment of those rights. There can be no assurance that companies involved in cloud-based computing </span><span>and data storage will be able to successfully protect their intellectual property to prevent the misappropriation of their </span><span>technology, or that competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior.</span></div> <div><span>Cloud-based computing and data storage companies also depend on a number of third parties to provide services to data </span><span>centers, which, if interrupted, may impact products and services. These companies are also potential targets for cyberattacks, </span><span>which may have a materially adverse impact on the performance of these companies. These companies may also be affected </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Cloud-based computing may face increasing regulatory </span><span>scrutiny and legal liability, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the growth of companies that </span><span>develop or use this technology. Similarly, the collection of data from consumers and other sources, and storage of that data, </span><span>may face increased scrutiny as regulators consider how data may be collected, stored, safeguarded and used. In the event of </span><span>a data breach or a similar incident, cloud-based computing and data storage companies may face legal liability.</span></div> <div><span>Commodities Investment Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Exposure to commodities markets may subject a Fund to greater volatility than investments </span><span>in traditional securities. The commodities markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility. Similar future market </span><span>conditions may result in rapid and substantial valuation increases or decreases in a Fund’s holdings.</span></div> <div><span>The commodities markets may fluctuate widely based on a variety of factors. Movements in commodity investment prices </span><span>are outside of a Fund's control and may not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements may be influenced by, among other </span><span>things: governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; changing market and </span><span>economic conditions; market liquidity; weather and climate conditions, including droughts and floods; livestock disease; </span><span>changing supply and demand relationships and levels of domestic production and imported commodities; changes in </span><span>storage costs; the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; energy conservation; the success of </span><span>exploration projects; changes in international balances of payments and trade; domestic and foreign rates of inflation; </span><span>currency devaluations and revaluations; domestic and foreign political and economic events; domestic and foreign interest </span><span>rates and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates; foreign currency/exchange rates; domestic and foreign </span><span>governmental regulation and taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other political upheaval and conflicts; governmental </span><span>expropriation; investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and commodities funds; and changes in </span><span>philosophies and emotions of market participants. The frequency and magnitude of such changes cannot be predicted.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The prices of commodities can also fluctuate widely due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or </span><span>consuming regions. Certain commodities or natural resources may be produced in a limited number of countries and may be </span><span>controlled by a small number of producers or groups of producers. As a result, political, economic, regulatory and supply-related</span><span> events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on the prices of such commodities.</span></div> <div><span>A decrease in the production of a physical commodity or a decrease in the volume of such commodity available for </span><span>transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution may adversely impact the financial performance of a commodity </span><span>or commodity-related company that devotes a portion of its business to that commodity. Production declines and volume </span><span>decreases could be caused by various factors, including catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources, </span><span>labor difficulties, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected maintenance </span><span>problems, import supply disruption, governmental expropriation, political upheaval or conflicts or increased competition </span><span>from alternative energy sources or commodity prices. Agricultural commodities may be adversely affected by weather or </span><span>other natural phenomena, such as drought, floods and pests.</span></div> <div><span>A sustained decline in demand for such commodities could also adversely affect the financial performance of commodity-related</span><span> companies. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic recession or other adverse economic </span><span>conditions, higher taxes on commodities or increased governmental regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts </span><span>to the use of alternative commodities or fuel sources, changes in commodity prices, or weather.</span></div> <div><span>The commodity markets are subject to temporary distortions and other disruptions due to, among other factors, lack of </span><span>liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and other actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some </span><span>foreign exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices which may occur in a single business day </span><span>(generally referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>daily price fluctuation limits</span><span>”</span><span>). The maximum or minimum price of a contract as a result of these </span><span>limits is referred to as a </span><span>“</span><span>limit price.</span><span>”</span><span> If the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made </span><span>beyond the limit price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of </span><span>contracts at disadvantageous times or prices.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Because each Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the </span><span>currency of a non-U.S. market in which a Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of a </span><span>Fund’s holdings in that market increases. Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security </span><span>denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar </span><span>decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is </span><span>worth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally known as </span><span>“</span><span>currency risk,</span><span>”</span><span> means that a strong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for </span><span>U.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will increase those returns.</span></div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected are highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange </span><span>transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange </span><span>transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the Fund’s performance and may lower a Fund’s return. A </span><span>Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency forward positions are poorly correlated with its other investments or </span><span>if it cannot close out its positions because of an illiquid market. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including </span><span>trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </span><span>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </span><span>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </span><span>compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with </span><span>investors and underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not declare dividends in </span><span>the future or will reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> <div><span>Reference Rate Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently transitioned from, or </span><span>continue to be tied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, </span><span>hedging strategies or investment value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which regulates LIBOR, </span><span>has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings will </span><span>continue to be published under a synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain legacy contracts. The Secured </span><span>Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. </span><span>Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments </span><span>and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates </span><span>based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</span></div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </span><span>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation of Offshore Renminbi and Remittance.</span><span>  </span><span>The offshore renminbi (</span><span>“</span><span>CNH</span><span>”</span><span>) market is a free market and the CNH </span><span>exchange rate is determined by market forces. Nevertheless, supply and demand for CNH are influenced by policies on cross-border</span><span> renminbi flows. As of the date of this SAI, the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (</span><span>“</span><span>BOCHK</span><span>”</span><span>) is the only clearing bank </span><span>for CNH in Hong Kong. The remittance of renminbi into the People’s Republic of China (</span><span>“</span><span>China</span><span>”</span><span> or the </span><span>“</span><span>PRC</span><span>”</span><span>) and the </span><span>repatriation of renminbi out of the PRC are dependent on the operational systems and procedures developed by the BOCHK </span><span>for such purposes and there is no assurance that there will not be delays in remittance and/or repatriation.</span></div> <div><span>Any delays in, or restrictions imposed on, the remittance and/or repatriation of the Fund’s cash into or out of the PRC will </span><span>have an impact on the Fund’s ability to purchase stocks required in order to effectively track the Underlying Index and may </span><span>increase the level of tracking error. Such delays or restrictions will also impact the Fund’s ability to repatriate cash for the </span><span>purposes of or otherwise in connection with redemption requests.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500</span><span>®</span><span> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other </span><span>derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in </span><span>market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional </span><span>securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not </span><span>fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage.</span></div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Equity Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </span><span>investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </span><span>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio </span><span>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </span><span>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor </span><span>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </span><span>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </span><span>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular </span><span>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </span><span>significant </span><span>“</span><span>short</span><span>”</span><span> positions taken by institutional investors).</span></div> <div><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </span><span>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </span><span>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, </span><span>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </span><span>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at </span><span>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for </span><span>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </span><span>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </span><span>maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a </span><span>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </span><span>bid/ask spreads are wide.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </span><span>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </span><span>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to the </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>An investment in any of the Funds involves risks similar to those of investing </span><span>in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such </span><span>factors as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in </span><span>stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and </span><span>denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically </span><span>encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations </span><span>include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the </span><span>costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in any of the Funds also </span><span>involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively </span><span>securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price </span><span>volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks </span><span>attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller </span><span>market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more </span><span>substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, </span><span>and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </span><span>rights as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</span></div> <div><span>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </span><span>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose </span><span>money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could </span><span>also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of </span><span>any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a Fund’s performance from that of </span><span>the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </span><span>instruments held in a Fund’s portfolio and those included in its applicable underlying index, pricing differences, transaction </span><span>costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of </span><span>dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through</span><span> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </span><span>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to a Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other </span><span>unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a Fund incurs fees and expenses, while its applicable </span><span>underlying index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the </span><span>value of the applicable Underlying Index and determining a Fund’s NAV.</span></div> <div><span>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </span><span>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </span><span>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </span><span>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be </span><span>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </span><span>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </span><span>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </span><span>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </span><span>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the </span><span>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </span><span>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying </span><span>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to a Fund’s net asset value if </span><span>one or more such securities declines in value.</span></div> <div><span>Volatility Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The value of a security may fluctuate due to factors affecting markets generally or particular industries. This </span><span>volatility may affect a Fund's NAV. Although the Underlying Index was created to seek lower absolute volatility, there is no </span><span>guarantee that these strategies will be successful. An underlying index's index provider may be unsuccessful in creating an </span><span>index that minimizes volatility, and there is a risk that each Fund may experience more than minimum volatility. Securities in </span><span>the Funds' portfolios may be subject to price volatility and their prices may not be any less volatile than the market as a whole </span><span>and could be more volatile. Events or financial circumstances affecting individual securities or sectors may increase the </span><span>volatility of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Small-Capitalization Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile </span><span>than those of larger companies, and, therefore, a Fund's share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a </span><span>larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies. Stock prices of </span><span>small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization or mid-capitalization </span><span>companies to adverse business and economic developments. The stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly </span><span>traded, making it difficult for the Funds to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less </span><span>financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, </span><span>making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product </span><span>lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</span></div> <div><span>Indian Economic Trading Partner Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The Indian economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and </span><span>social instability. Disparities of wealth, the pace of economic liberalization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection may </span><span>lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest in India. In addition, India continues to experience religious and border </span><span>disputes as well as separatist movements in certain Indian states. Unanticipated political or social developments may have an </span><span>adverse effect on India’s economy. The Indian government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to </span><span>liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the Indian economy, control the rate of inflation, reduce government </span><span>control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can be no assurance these reforms will continue or that they </span><span>will be effective. The Indian government has experienced chronic structural public sector deficits. High amounts of debt and </span><span>public spending may stifle Indian economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. The Indian economy has grown </span><span>rapidly during the past several years and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. India may experience </span><span>substantial (and, in some cases, extremely high) rates of inflation or economic recessions causing a negative effect on the </span><span>Indian economy.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Africa.</span><span>  </span><span>Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks </span><span>including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including </span><span>authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as </span><span>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries, </span><span>genocidal warfare.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, </span><span>consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of </span><span>countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those </span><span>markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated </span><span>with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and </span><span>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended </span><span>altogether.</span></div> <div><span>Market volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in </span><span>Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need </span><span>to effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund </span><span>effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in </span><span>securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental </span><span>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign </span><span>investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an </span><span>issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries </span><span>and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay </span><span>investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is </span><span>pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to </span><span>invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier </span><span>than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a </span><span>decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the </span><span>same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less </span><span>financial and other information publicly available with regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such </span><span>issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers </span><span>located or operating in more developed countries.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, governments of certain countries in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on </span><span>income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes </span><span>are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in </span><span>such countries.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater degree of risk associated with governmental approval in </span><span>connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In </span><span>addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s balance of payments declines, such African country may impose </span><span>temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a </span><span>refusal to grant, required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any </span><span>restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, </span><span>seek local government approvals or take other actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and </span><span>unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. </span><span>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be </span><span>no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of </span><span>corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to </span><span>which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such </span><span>countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. </span><span>Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable </span><span>enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in </span><span>Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</span></div> <div><span>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries </span><span>in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. </span><span>These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In </span><span>addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </span><span>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </span><span>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </span><span>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </span><span>indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector </span><span>and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic </span><span>conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of </span><span>diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may </span><span>be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</span></div> <div><span>Political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused and may in the future cause significant </span><span>disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries </span><span>in those countries and adversely impacted the region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has </span><span>further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly </span><span>through the region, and that developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some </span><span>protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a </span><span>risk to investments in the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and </span><span>terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service and tourism </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, </span><span>such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of </span><span>Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., </span><span>Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies </span><span>of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign </span><span>ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade </span><span>foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of certain Central and South American countries have </span><span>experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, regime changes, </span><span>high unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, </span><span>commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many </span><span>economies in these regions are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one </span><span>country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</span></div> <div><span>The governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of </span><span>the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the </span><span>economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests. </span><span>Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some </span><span>countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</span></div> <div><span>Certain countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have </span><span>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative </span><span>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These </span><span>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they </span><span>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may be the </span><span>subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and </span><span>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. </span><span>government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An </span><span>issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may </span><span>be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and </span><span>special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include, </span><span>among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and </span><span>social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries.</span></div> <div><span>Military conflicts, either in response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic </span><span>development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes </span><span>with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people </span><span>in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, </span><span>and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of </span><span>the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese </span><span>markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. </span><span>Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may </span><span>adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia </span><span>and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and </span><span>threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of </span><span>securities in which a Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability </span><span>within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the performance </span><span>of the Chinese economy.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, the </span><span>Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </span><span>many companies. Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. The </span><span>Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of </span><span>loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign </span><span>investments</span><span> </span><span>and on repatriation of capital invested.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A Fund may invest in securities issued by variable interest entities (</span><span>“</span><span>VIEs</span><span>”</span><span>), which are subject to the investment risks </span><span>associated with the underlying Chinese operating company. A VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the </span><span>Chinese operating company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership </span><span>of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating </span><span>company into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect </span><span>the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese </span><span>company.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and </span><span>other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on </span><span>U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider </span><span>trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the </span><span>requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of </span><span>change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions </span><span>and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese </span><span>companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select </span><span>investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will </span><span>recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, causing a </span><span>negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in </span><span>spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other </span><span>trade barriers</span><span> </span><span>(including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse </span><span>impact on the Chinese economy and the companies in which a Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change </span><span>from time to time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other </span><span>governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of such government. For example, certain foreign </span><span>technology companies are subject to U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. The </span><span>U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain Chinese companies due to concerns about </span><span>forced labor. Such restrictions may have unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any </span><span>action that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or </span><span>cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index of a Fund may include companies that are subject to economic or trade </span><span>restrictions (but not investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these restrictions do not </span><span>include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective </span><span>to track the performance of its Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of China (</span><span>“</span><span>PRC</span><span>”</span><span>) are subject to change, including the issuance of </span><span>authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of </span><span>such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary </span><span>over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect </span><span>on a Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, </span><span>the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may be less </span><span>rigorous, and may result in significant differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with the PRC </span><span>accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of companies </span><span>incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>SEHK</span><span>”</span><span>)), A-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the </span><span>Shanghai Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>SSE</span><span>”</span><span>) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>SZSE</span><span>”</span><span>)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies </span><span>incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the </span><span>SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong-listed securities known as </span><span>Red-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, </span><span>directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial </span><span>revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in </span><span>certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial </span><span>revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two classes: A-shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, </span><span>and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to </span><span>greater government restrictions, including trading suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares </span><span>market is generally smaller and less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to </span><span>significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at </span><span>significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the </span><span>ability to obtain a </span><span>“</span><span>back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> through Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an </span><span>experiment in economic reform. </span><span>“</span><span>Back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or </span><span>P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the </span><span>political and economic policies in China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government </span><span>intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may </span><span>make it difficult to acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect.</span></div> <div><span>The iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies ETF, iShares Global Equity Factor ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All </span><span>Country Asia ex Japan ETF and iShares MSCI China A ETF may invest in A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock </span><span>Connect program (</span><span>“</span><span>Shanghai Connect</span><span>”</span><span>) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (</span><span>“</span><span>Shenzhen Connect,</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>together with Shanghai Connect, </span><span>“</span><span>Stock Connect</span><span>”</span><span>). Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program with an aim </span><span>to achieve mutual stock market access between the PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed by Hong Kong </span><span>Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect), </span><span>and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (</span><span>“</span><span>CSDCC</span><span>”</span><span>). Under Stock Connect, a Fund’s trading of </span><span>eligible A-shares listed on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong brokers. Investing </span><span>in A-shares through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures, which could pose risks </span><span>to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Although no individual investment quotas or licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect, trading through </span><span>Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the </span><span>“</span><span>Daily Quota</span><span>”</span><span>), which limits the maximum net purchases under Stock Connect </span><span>each day. The Daily Quota does not belong to a Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders for </span><span>A-shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although a Fund will be permitted to sell A-shares regardless </span><span>of the Daily Quota balance). The Daily Quota may restrict a Fund’s ability to invest in A-shares through Stock Connect on a </span><span>timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota is also subject </span><span>to change.</span></div> <div><span>A-shares purchased through Stock Connect generally may only be sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and </span><span>in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market rules and to facilitate orderly operations </span><span>of a Fund, including the timely settlement of Stock Connect trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an </span><span>operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A-shares through Stock Connect. Such operating </span><span>model may reduce the risks of trade failures; however, it will also allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without prior </span><span>verification by a Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject a Fund to additional risks, including an increased risk of </span><span>inadvertently exceeding certain trade or other restrictions or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened </span><span>risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>While A-shares must be designated as eligible to be traded through Stock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed on the SSE, </span><span>the </span><span>“</span><span>SSE Securities,</span><span>”</span><span> and such eligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the </span><span>“</span><span>SZSE Securities</span><span>”</span><span>), those A-shares may also lose such </span><span>designation, and if this occurs, such A-shares may be sold but could no longer be purchased through Stock Connect. With </span><span>respect to sell orders under Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A-shares</span><span> in its account before the market opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A-shares in an </span><span>investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact a </span><span>Fund’s performance.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, Stock Connect operates only on days when both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are open for trading and </span><span>when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement days. Therefore, an investment in A-shares</span><span> through Stock Connect may subject a Fund to the risk of price fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets are </span><span>open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading under Stock </span><span>Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is effected, a Fund’s ability to access A-shares </span><span>through Stock Connect will be adversely affected. In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are </span><span>closed on a U.S. trading day, a Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of A-shares through Stock Connect in a timely </span><span>manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s performance.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in A-shares though Stock Connect are held by its custodian in accounts in the Central Clearing and </span><span>Settlement System (</span><span>“</span><span>CCASS</span><span>”</span><span>) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (</span><span>“</span><span>HKSCC</span><span>”</span><span>), which in turn </span><span>holds the A-shares, as the nominee holder, through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with the CSDCC. </span><span>The precise nature and rights of a Fund as the beneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as </span><span>nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There is a lack of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership </span><span>and beneficial ownership under PRC law, and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in the PRC </span><span>courts. The exact nature and methods of enforcement of the rights and interests of a Fund under PRC law are also uncertain. </span><span>In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding-up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE </span><span>Securities or SZSE Securities may not be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of a Fund or as part of the general </span><span>assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors.</span></div> <div><span>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its </span><span>omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still treat </span><span>HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities. </span><span>HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS </span><span>informed of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take steps in order to participate in them. A Fund </span><span>will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and notification and implementation of corporate actions.</span></div> <div><span>The HKSCC is responsible for the clearing, settlement and provision of depositary, nominee and other related services of the </span><span>trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors. Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE </span><span>Securities directly; rather, they are held through their brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The HKSCC and the </span><span>CSDCC establish clearing links and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border</span><span> trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its </span><span>market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against </span><span>the CSDCC. In that event, a Fund may suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses from </span><span>the CSDCC.</span></div> <div><span>Market participants are able to participate in Stock Connect subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk </span><span>management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the </span><span>“</span><span>connectivity</span><span>”</span><span> in Stock Connect requires the routing of orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires </span><span>the development of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no </span><span>assurance that these systems will function properly or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both </span><span>markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A-shares through Stock Connect could be </span><span>disrupted, and a Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>The Shanghai Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December </span><span>2016, do not have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory </span><span>authorities and implementation rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to </span><span>how the current regulations will be applied or interpreted going forward, and new or revised regulations may be issued from </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, there can be no assurance that Stock Connect will </span><span>not be discontinued. A Fund may be adversely affected as a result of such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes and </span><span>legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, different </span><span>fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors acquiring A-shares through Stock Connect, and these fees, costs and </span><span>taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities providing similar </span><span>investment exposure.</span></div> <div><span>A-Share Market Suspension Risk.</span></div> <div><span>A-shares may only be bought from, or sold to, a Fund at times when the relevant A-shares may be sold or purchased on the </span><span>relevant Chinese stock exchange. The A-shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many </span><span>other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks could lead to greater market execution risk, valuation </span><span>risks, and liquidity risks and costs for a Fund, as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of </span><span>the Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily limit, set at 10%, of the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of </span><span>A-shares during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not restrict trading within the </span><span>relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular A-share or for any </span><span>particular time. This could increase a Fund’s tracking error and/or cause a Fund to trade in the market at greater bid-ask </span><span>spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Given that the A-share market is considered volatile and </span><span>unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and redemption of </span><span>Creation Units may also be disrupted.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </span><span>investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </span><span>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </span><span>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </span><span>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors </span><span>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </span><span>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be </span><span>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by </span><span>local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there </span><span>may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </span><span>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </span><span>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </span><span>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </span><span>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </span><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </span><span>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </span><span>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </span><span>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </span><span>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </span><span>by nationals.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </span><span>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </span><span>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on </span><span>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </span><span>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in </span><span>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </span><span>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </span><span>have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain </span><span>European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span><span>euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The United Kingdom (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </span><span>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Japan. </span><span> </span><span>Japan may be subject to political, economic, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually </span><span>or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk</span><span>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports </span><span>that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain </span><span>or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate </span><span>sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk</span><span>. The growth of Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed </span><span>economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and </span><span>it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely </span><span>affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions </span><span>of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a </span><span>negative impact on the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk</span><span>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or </span><span>surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Labor Risk</span><span>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor </span><span>market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime </span><span>employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic </span><span>competitiveness.</span> <br/></div> <div><span>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</span><span>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with </span><span>large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major </span><span>corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a </span><span>slowdown of the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Political Risk</span><span>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future </span><span>political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has </span><span>become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should </span><span>political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been </span><span>strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has </span><span>shown concern over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause </span><span>uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </span><span> </span><span>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </span><span>and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly </span><span>reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and </span><span>their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As </span><span>global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many </span><span>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </span><span>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a </span><span>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, </span><span>as well as the value of securities in a Fund's portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of </span><span>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in </span><span>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</span></div> <div><span>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential </span><span>liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the </span><span>shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. Each Fund </span><span>therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount </span><span>greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more </span><span>limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal </span><span>judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on </span><span>investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain </span><span>countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by </span><span>foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a </span><span>specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer </span><span>available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</span></div> <div><span>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on </span><span>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a </span><span>Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased </span><span>re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result </span><span>in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be </span><span>made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is </span><span>subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors </span><span>has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment </span><span>income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental </span><span>approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </span><span>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </span><span>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </span><span>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </span><span>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </span><span>indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </span><span>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as </span><span>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </span><span>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </span><span>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may </span><span>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </span><span>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in North America. </span><span> </span><span>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </span><span>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </span><span>all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </span></div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </span><span>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of </span><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and </span><span>legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value </span><span>of certain securities held by a Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Russia. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special </span><span>considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly </span><span>speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private </span><span>property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result of </span><span>expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, </span><span>restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and potentially greater price </span><span>volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no </span><span>assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise </span><span>confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a </span><span>Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the </span><span>Russian court system.</span></div> <div><span>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic, political and social instability than is the case in other developed </span><span>countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military </span><span>involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in government through extra-constitutional </span><span>means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal </span><span>insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations, including armed conflict, with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial </span><span>disaffection.</span></div> <div><span>The Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, </span><span>forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly </span><span>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or </span><span>internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia </span><span>produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of </span><span>Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, </span><span>results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the </span><span>Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</span></div> <div><span>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </span><span>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which </span><span>could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could </span><span>adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its </span><span>regional geopolitical influence (including military steps) and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. </span><span>Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </span><span>governments. Such steps have increased tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may </span><span>negatively affect economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For </span><span>example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry </span><span>and Security’s </span><span>“</span><span>Entity List,</span><span>”</span><span> which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these </span><span>may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Russian economy.</span></div> <div><span>Russian invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russia Sanctions</span><span>. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Sanctioning Bodies</span><span>”</span><span>) have imposed </span><span>economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking entities, </span><span>including banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or </span><span>others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result </span><span>in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the </span><span>Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in </span><span>prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Recently, Russia </span><span>has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>dividends), and prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>as well as the export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons.</span></div> <div><span>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity </span><span>of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, </span><span>hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a </span><span>Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>affected securities</span><span>”</span><span>), or if deemed </span><span>appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions </span><span>and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund’s transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required </span><span>to freeze assets in a blocked account.</span></div> <div><span>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity </span><span>of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due to such </span><span>a freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy </span><span>any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially </span><span>lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which may further impair the value and </span><span>liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number </span><span>of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, dividends), and </span><span>prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> as well as the </span><span>export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian companies may be unable to </span><span>pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive them.</span></div> <div><span>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident </span><span>investors from executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in the Fund's Underlying Index. The Fund’s </span><span>Index Provider has removed Russian securities from the Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund rebalances its portfolio </span><span>and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the investment results of the Underlying Index, this may result in </span><span>transaction costs and increased tracking error. The Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including </span><span>those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. This disparity will also lead to increased </span><span>tracking error. The inability of the Fund to trade in Russian securities may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet its </span><span>investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will </span><span>resume.</span></div> <div><span>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund’s Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its </span><span>holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the </span><span>investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a </span><span>Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may </span><span>not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error </span><span>between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. </span><span> </span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in the securities of Saudi </span><span>Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and </span><span>unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market </span><span>Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>CMA</span><span>”</span><span>) places investment limitations on the ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign </span><span>investors, including a limitation on a Fund’s ownership of the securities of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock </span><span>Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special </span><span>approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such </span><span>licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, </span><span>compared to more developed markets, given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. </span><span>Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, </span><span>among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, </span><span>including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as </span><span>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, </span><span>certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored </span><span>competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due </span><span>to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and </span><span>legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries </span><span>involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the </span><span>market for petroleum, as well as acts targeting petroleum production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global </span><span>demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian </span><span>government has explored privatization and diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</span></div> <div><span>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of </span><span>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: </span><span>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is </span><span>exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced </span><span>strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. </span><span>Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their </span><span>markets and may adversely affect its economy and a Fund’s investments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect </span><span>private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on </span><span>Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the </span><span>value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi </span><span>Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or funds investing </span><span>in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, </span><span>Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have </span><span>an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> <div><span>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in </span><span>Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, </span><span>illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control </span><span>and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than </span><span>those of companies on exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of </span><span>these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, </span><span>and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region </span><span>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government </span><span>interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or </span><span>other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies </span><span>regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries </span><span>may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a </span><span>result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. </span><span>imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </span><span>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result, </span><span>securities to which a Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused </span><span>significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value </span><span>of securities in a Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or </span><span>embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as </span><span>state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which </span><span>operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those </span><span>risks.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the </span><span>automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may </span><span>be, at times, excess capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. </span><span>automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. </span><span>government, while others formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. </span><span>In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased </span><span>pension liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </span><span>commodity price volatility, inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased </span><span>competition. Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. </span><span>Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic </span><span>materials operations, and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a </span><span>result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are </span><span>at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays </span><span>in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </span><span>environmental policies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </span><span>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, </span><span>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </span><span>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </span><span>products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </span><span>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services </span><span>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </span><span>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer </span><span>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of </span><span>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </span><span>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </span><span>world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </span><span>communications services industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including </span><span>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, </span><span>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </span><span>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </span><span>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </span><span>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </span><span>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </span><span>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be </span><span>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </span><span>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, </span><span>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </span><span>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </span><span>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </span><span>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </span><span>less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily </span><span>on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail </span><span>companies, and housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, </span><span>including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor </span><span>relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government </span><span>regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </span><span>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </span><span>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot </span><span>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </span><span>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes </span><span>distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical and is highly </span><span>dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of </span><span>time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the </span><span>regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, </span><span>and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability from </span><span>accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and gas </span><span>deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </span><span>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </span><span>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </span><span>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </span><span>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental </span><span>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </span><span>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </span><span>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </span><span>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </span><span>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </span><span>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </span><span>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </span><span>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </span><span>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to </span><span>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </span><span>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely </span><span>affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, </span><span>product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Information technology companies face intense competition, both </span><span>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </span><span>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </span><span>of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </span><span>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </span><span>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, </span><span>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </span><span>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </span><span>to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </span><span>certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span><span>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. </span><span>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </span><span>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Producer Durables Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The producer durables industry includes companies involved in the </span><span>design, manufacture or distribution of industrial durables such as electrical equipment and components, industrial products, </span><span>and housing and telecommunications equipment. These companies may be affected by changes in domestic and </span><span>international economies and politics, consolidation, and excess capacity. Companies in the producer durables industry face </span><span>intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the producer </span><span>durables industry may be strongly affected by changes in consumer demands, spending, tastes and preferences. Companies </span><span>in the producer durables industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Producer </span><span>durables companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual </span><span>property rights of others. In addition, these companies may be significantly affected by other factors such as economic </span><span>cycles, rapid technical obsolescence, government regulations, labor relations, delays in modernization, overall capital </span><span>spending levels and product liability lawsuits.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing </span><span>proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </span><span>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures </span><span>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </span><span>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix A.</span></div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain information may also be made available to certain parties:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Communications of Data Files: </span><span>A Fund may make available through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing </span><span>Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>NSCC</span><span>”</span><span>) or through posting on the </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>, prior to the opening of trading on each business </span><span>day, a list of a Fund’s holdings (generally pro-rata) that Authorized Participants could deliver to a Fund to settle </span><span>purchases of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Deposit Securities) or that Authorized Participants would receive from a Fund to settle </span><span>redemptions of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Fund Securities).

The Index Provider excludes constituents with an average three-month trailing </span><span>daily trading volume of less than $2 million or a free float market capitalization of less than $300 million. Current index </span><span>constituents are eliminated if they have an average three-month trailing daily trading volume of less than $1.5 million or a </span><span>free float market capitalization of less than $200 million.

Certain exclusions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> </span><span>controversial and nuclear weapons or the production of tobacco products) are categorical, and other exclusions are based on </span><span>percentage of revenue or ownership thresholds (as discussed below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Categorical exclusions include any issuer that has any involvement in:</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>the sale of assault or non-assault weapons;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>the manufacture of small arms components;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>the production of tobacco products; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>controversial and nuclear weapons (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> antipersonnel mines, biological and chemical weapons, depleted uranium, </span><span>nuclear weapons, or white phosphorus).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Additionally, the Index Provider categorically excludes companies that it determines are involved in controversies related to </span><span>the ten United Nations Global Compact (</span><span>“</span><span>UNGC</span><span>”</span><span>) principles, which are classified into four categories: human rights, labor, </span><span>environment and anti-corruption. The Index Provider relies on the assessment of a third party data provider, Sustainalytics, to </span><span>determine whether an issuer has violated the principles of the UNGC. To make this determination, Sustainalytics analyzes </span><span>publicly reported allegations of adverse impacts caused by businesses and provides assessments based on the UNGC </span><span>principles, categorizing those businesses as either </span><span>“</span><span>Non-compliant,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>Watchlist,</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Compliant.</span><span>”</span><span> Companies that </span><span>Sustainalytics determines are Non-Compliant typically are causing or contributing to severe and/or systemic violations of </span><span>international norms and are not acting in accordance with the UNGC principles and their associated standards, conventions, </span><span>and treaties. All companies that Sustainalytics determines to be Non-Compliant are excluded from the Underlying Index.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Further, the Index Provider categorically excludes companies that Sustainalytics has assigned a controversy score of 5 </span><span>(indicating the company experienced an event with a severe impact on the environment and society), or companies which </span><span>have not been assigned a controversy score. Sustainalytics assesses companies’ involvement in </span><span>“</span><span>incidents</span><span>”</span><span> with negative </span><span>environmental, social, and governance implications and assigns a </span><span>“</span><span>controversy score</span><span>”</span><span>, which reflects a company’s level of </span><span>involvement in issues and how it manages these issues. An incident is a company activity with unintended and/or undesired </span><span>negative environmental and/or social impacts on stakeholders. Incidents are primarily assessed based on the negative </span><span>environmental and/or social impact of the company activity as well as the reputational risk that this activity poses to the </span><span>company and scored on a scale of 1 to 10. Incident scores serve as a guide to help Sustainalytics analysts determine the </span><span>event rating. </span><span>“</span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span> are series of isolated or related incidents that pertain to the same ESG issues. An event is assessed on a </span><span>scale of 5 levels, with level 5 being severe, and the assessment takes into account the score of each incident comprising the </span><span>event to determine the event level. A </span><span>“</span><span>controversy</span><span>”</span><span> is an event or aggregation of events relating to an ESG topic. The highest </span><span>event rating under a controversy indicator automatically becomes the controversy score. Any company which receives either </span><span>a controversy score of 5, or is not assessed at all, is excluded from the Underlying Index.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider also excludes issuers from the Underlying Index if they exceed any of the following revenue and </span><span>ownership thresholds:</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>over 5% of an issuer’s revenue is derived from thermal coal extraction or generation;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>over 5% of an issuer’s revenue is derived from oil sands extraction;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>over 5% of an issuer’s business is involved in the retail or distribution of assault or non-assault weapons;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Sustainable products could include the distribution and management of </span><span>energy efficient materials or products, or pollution remediation services. The Index Provider determines whether a company </span><span>has sustainable activities involvement revenue by breaking down the companywide revenue into the following eight </span><span>sustainable themes: Energy Efficiency, Green Buildings, Green Transportation, Pollution Prevention &amp; Reduction, Renewable </span><span>Energy, Resource Efficiency Technologies &amp; Services, Sustainable Agriculture, Food &amp; Forestry, and Water. The Index Provider </span><span>then applies the first revenue screen, excluding companies with a total sustainable activities involvement revenue of less than </span><span>25% from the Underlying Index.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Following the first revenue screen, Morningstar equity analysts then research the products or services identified within the </span><span>eight sustainable themes to determine whether the products or services fall within the following categories, as defined by </span><span>Morningstar: </span><span>“</span><span>green technologies</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>green services</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>green certifications.</span><span>”</span><span> Green technologies are products and services </span><span>that are highly innovative toward sustainability. Green services are services which rely on innovative technologies developed </span><span>by other companies. Green certified means that an industry regulator or other third party has certified the product or service </span><span>as sustainable or has certified the elements within the supply chain of the product or service as sustainable. Morningstar </span><span>equity analysts consider various metrics to make this determination (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> research and development as a percentage of </span><span>revenue and company-level patent application data). Morningstar excludes all revenue tied to products and services </span><span>classified as </span><span>“</span><span>green services</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>green certified.</span><span>”</span><span> Morningstar reviews the green technologies and assesses whether each </span><span>qualifies as an emerging green technology.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The products and services classified as </span><span>“</span><span>green technologies</span><span>”</span><span> are assessed by Morningstar equity analysts and distributed </span><span>within the Rogers Innovation Adoption Curve (</span><span>“</span><span>Adoption Curve</span><span>”</span><span>) The Adoption Curve is a theory created by Professor Everett </span><span>Rogers that explains the rate at which the population adopts a new product, service, or technology over time, and which </span><span>labels each product or service as one of five adoption stages: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and </span><span>Laggards. Morningstar assesses a product or service’s total addressable market and current market share to determine the </span><span>adoption stage. Morningstar Equity Research then classifies the products and services that are labeled Innovators, Early </span><span>Adopters, and Early Majority as </span><span>“</span><span>emerging green technologies</span><span>”</span><span>. Once Morningstar identifies the emerging green </span><span>technologies, Morningstar then applies a second revenue screen: companies with 25% or more of their revenue represented </span><span>by emerging green technologies are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Following the second revenue screen, the resulting constituents receive an innovation score based on their products’ and/or </span><span>services’ adoption stage, as follows:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Innovation Score of 1: Early Majority</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Innovation Score of 2: Early Adopters</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Innovation Score of 3: Innovators</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>The Index Provider calculates a company-level aggregate score by multiplying the company’s revenue percentage of each </span><span>product and/or service identified as an emerging green technology within each of the eight sustainable themes, and the </span><span>product and/or service’s innovation score, creating a </span><span>“</span><span>product score</span><span>”</span><span>. Each product score is summed across the company’s </span><span>products and/or services, resulting in the company’s aggregate score. For example, suppose Morningstar analyzed Company </span><span>A’s products and services across the eight sustainable themes, and found that 71.7% of Company A’s revenue is allocated to </span><span>the Energy Efficiency sustainable theme from Product X, and 28.3% of its revenue is allocated to the Green Transportation </span><span>sustainable theme from Product Y. Further, Morningstar determined both products to be emerging green technologies and </span><span>that Product X is an </span><span>“</span><span>innovator</span><span>”</span><span> on the Adoption Curve, earning an innovation score of 3, and Product Y is an </span><span>“</span><span>early adopter,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>earning an innovation score of 2. Each products’ revenues are multiplied by their respective innovation scores to determine </span><span>their product scores. Product X’s resulting product score is 2.15 (71.7% times 3), and Product Y’s resulting product score is </span><span>0.57 (28.3% times 2). Company A’s resulting aggregate score is 2.72, resulting in a Tier 1 designation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>43</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Once Morningstar calculates each constituent’s aggregate score, Morningstar designates each constituent as either Tier 1 or </span><span>Tier 2 based on their aggregate score. Tier 1 issuers are those with an aggregate score of 1.5 or higher. Tier 2 issuers are </span><span>those with an aggregate score of less than 1.5. All Tier 1 constituents are selected for the Underlying Index. The Index </span><span>Provider ranks Tier 2 issuers with preference given to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Higher aggregate score over lower aggregate score</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Smaller market capitalization over larger market capitalization</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>If there are fewer than 50 Tier 1 constituents, the shortfall is filled with Tier 2 constituents, and the Underlying Index is </span><span>capped at 50 constituents.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Constituents are float market capitalization-weighted with a 6% cap for individual stocks and each industry is capped at </span><span>15%. Additionally, individual constituents with weights of 4.5% or greater cannot compose more than 45% of the Underlying </span><span>Index. The Underlying Index is reconstituted annually each December and rebalanced quarterly. The Index Provider does not </span><span>require that each of the eight sustainable themes be included in the Underlying Index, nor does it require the inclusion of a </span><span>minimum number of Tier 1 constituents. In addition, constituents may operate business lines that generate revenues in </span><span>industries in addition to those related to breakthrough innovations and new technologies and may be associated with </span><span>multiple industries or sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology</span><span>. The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. Morningstar uses </span><span>the country of incorporation of the constituents to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the </span><span>net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of </span><span>the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes </span><span>withheld at the rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such </span><span>withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents.</span></div> <div><span>The MSCI Indexes</span></div> <div><span>The MSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by Capital International S.A. as international performance benchmarks constructed </span><span>to facilitate comparison of world markets. The MSCI single country standard equity indexes have covered the world's </span><span>developed markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced coverage of emerging markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Local stock exchanges traditionally calculated their own indexes, which were generally not comparable with one another due </span><span>to differences in the representation of the local market, mathematical formulas, base dates and methods of adjusting for </span><span>capital changes.

In each market, MSCI creates an Investable </span><span>Market Index, Standard Index, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap Index, </span><span>Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are each subsets of the Investable Market Index for a market. The MSCI Global Standard </span><span>Index is the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and Mid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the aggregation of the MSCI Global </span><span>Standard Index and MSCI Global Small Cap Index.</span></div> <div><span>Selection Criteria.</span><span> MSCI's index construction process involves: (i) defining the equity universe; (ii) determining the market </span><span>investable equity universe for each market; (iii) determining market capitalization size segments for each market; (iv) </span><span>applying final size segment investability requirements; and (v) applying index continuity rules for the MSCI Global Standard </span><span>Index.</span></div> <div><span>Defining the Equity Universe</span><span>.

Some investability requirements are </span><span>applied at the individual security level and some at the overall company level, represented by the aggregation of individual </span><span>securities of the company. As a result, the inclusion or exclusion of one security does not imply the automatic inclusion or </span><span>exclusion of other securities of the same company.</span></div> <div><span>Determining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.</span><span> In order to create size components that can be </span><span>meaningfully aggregated into composites, individual market size segments balance the following two objectives:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving global size integrity by ensuring that companies of comparable and relevant sizes are included in a given size </span><span>segment across all markets in a composite index; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving consistent market coverage by ensuring that each market's size segment is represented in its proportional </span><span>weight in the composite universe.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>The Standard Indexes, Large Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small Cap Indexes capture the following market </span><span>capitalization size segments:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Standard Indexes cover all investable large- and mid-cap securities by including the largest issuers </span><span>comprising approximately 85% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Large Cap Indexes provide coverage of all investable large-cap securities by including the largest issuers </span><span>comprising approximately 70% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes provide coverage in each market by deriving the difference between the market coverage </span><span>of the MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI Global Large Cap Index in that market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of companies with a market capitalization below that of the companies </span><span>in the MSCI Global Standard Indexes.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Applying Final Size Segment Investability Requirements. </span><span>In order to enhance replicability of the indexes, additional size </span><span>segment investability requirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and MSCI Global Standard Index. These investability </span><span>requirements include minimum free float-adjusted market capitalization, minimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and </span><span>minimum length of trading.</span></div> <div><span>Applying Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Index.</span><span> In order to achieve index continuity as well as provide some basic </span><span>level of diversification within a market index, notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules contained herein, a </span><span>minimum number of five constituents will be maintained for a developed market Standard Index and a minimum number of </span><span>three constituents will be maintained for an emerging market Standard Index.</span></div> <div><span>Weighting.</span><span> All indexes of the MSCI GIMI are free float weighted, </span><span>i.e.,</span><span> companies are included in the indexes at the value of </span><span>their free public float (free float multiplied by security price).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regional Weights.</span><span> Market capitalization-weighting, combined with a consistent target of approximately 99% of free float-adjusted</span><span> market capitalization, helps ensure that each country's weight in regional and international indexes approximates its </span><span>weight in the total universe of developing and emerging markets. A market is equivalent to a single country except for </span><span>developed Europe, where all markets are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes. Individual country </span><span>indexes of the European developed markets are derived from the constituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.</span></div> <div><span>Free Float.</span><span> MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available </span><span>for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. In practice, limitations on free float available to </span><span>international investors include: (i) strategic and other shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits </span><span>on share ownership for foreigners.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI calculates the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security in the equity index universe by (i) defining and </span><span>estimating the free float available to foreign investors; (ii) assigning a free float-adjustment factor to each security; and (iii) </span><span>calculating the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>45</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under MSCI's free float-adjustment methodology, a constituent's inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded </span><span>up to the closest 5% for constituents with free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a </span><span>free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than </span><span>15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%.</span></div> <div><span>Price and Exchange Rates</span></div> <div><span>Prices.</span><span> The prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those figures accepted as </span><span>such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day.</span></div> <div><span>Exchange Rates.</span><span> MSCI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World </span><span>Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year's Day), </span><span>the previous business day's rates are normally used. MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. </span><span>MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters </span><span>rates are not available, or if MSCI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances </span><span>for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related </span><span>information. If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the </span><span>most relevant exchange rate.</span></div> <div><span>Changes to the Indexes.</span><span> The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of </span><span>the underlying equity markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and </span><span>minimizing turnover in the indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many aspects, including: (i) additions to, and </span><span>deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free </span><span>float estimates.</span></div> <div><span>Index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of changes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Semi-Annual Index Reviews (</span><span>“</span><span>SAIRs</span><span>”</span><span>), conducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable that systematically reassess the </span><span>various dimensions of the equity universe for all markets;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Quarterly Index Reviews (</span><span>“</span><span>QIRs</span><span>”</span><span>), aimed at promptly reflecting other significant market events; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Ongoing event-related changes, such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies, reorganizations and other similar </span><span>corporate events, which generally are implemented in the indexes as they occur.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Potential changes in the status of countries (stand-alone, frontier, emerging and developed) follow their own implementation </span><span>time tables.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI conducts SAIRs generally as of the close of the last business day of May and November. During the SAIRs, MSCI </span><span>updates the investable equity universe and reassesses size segmentation investability requirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs </span><span>generally as of the close of the last business day of February and August. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index </span><span>that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the next SAIR. </span><span>The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at least ten business days in advance of implementation.</span></div> <div><span>Creation of Sector and Industry Indexes using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>)</span></div> <div><span>All securities in the Global Investable Equity Universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities </span><span>using the GICS. The GICS consists of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries. Under the GICS, each company </span><span>is assigned to one unique sub-industry according to its principal business activity (generally defined as the business activity </span><span>that generates 60% or more of the company’s revenues). Narrower indexes may be derived based on industry classification, </span><span>and may contain securities belonging to specific sectors, industry groups, industries, sub-industries or a combination thereof.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI 25/50 Indexes</span> <br/></div> <div><span>Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes (the </span><span>“</span><span>25/50 Indexes</span><span>”</span><span>) is a sub-index of either an MSCI Global Standard Index or an MSCI </span><span>GIMI. Their construction reflects the diversification requirements applicable to RICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal </span><span>Revenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of </span><span>“</span><span>group entities</span><span>”</span><span> for the concentration limits of the capping methodologies in the </span><span>25/50 Indexes. A group entity is a group of companies that operate as an affiliated corporate group but may separately issue </span><span>listed securities. To determine </span><span>“</span><span>group entities,</span><span>”</span><span> MSCI analyzes financial accounts of listed companies holding stakes of 20% </span><span>or more in other listed companies to determine whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>46</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>absence of consolidated accounts, MSCI may also consider two companies as belonging to the same group entity where </span><span>there is reasonable evidence of control based on other information. The 25/50 Indexes are free float-adjusted market </span><span>capitalization-weighted indexes with a capping methodology applied to group entity weights so that no single group entity </span><span>exceeds 25% of index weight, and all group entities with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the index </span><span>weight. A buffer of 10% of the value of each of these caps is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short </span><span>term market movements between rebalances. As a result, at the point of constructing or rebalancing the 25/50 Indexes, the </span><span>weight of any single group entity cannot exceed 22.5% of the index weight and all group entities with weight above 4.5% </span><span>cannot exceed 45% of the index weight. A software application called the Barra Optimizer is utilized to calculate the capped </span><span>index weights through an optimization function which is aimed at minimizing index turnover, tracking error and extreme </span><span>deviation from the uncapped index.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI</span></div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 6,698</span></div> <div><span>Index Description.</span><span> The MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI is an MSCI GIMI Index.

The Underlying Index is </span><span>designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel </span><span>reserves. By overweighting companies with low carbon emissions relative to enterprise value including cash (EVIC) and those </span><span>with low potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves relative to market capitalization, the Underlying Index aims to </span><span>reflect a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market. The Underlying Index is designed to achieve a target level of </span><span>tracking error while minimizing carbon exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Index Methodology. </span><span>The Underlying Index begins with the MSCI ACWI Index, the parent index, which serves as the universe </span><span>of eligible securities for use in constructing the index. The aim of the construction methodology is for the Underlying Index to </span><span>demonstrate the following characteristics across markets by re-weighting constituents relative to the underlying free float-adjusted</span><span> market capitalization-weighted parent index: (1) lower carbon exposure in terms of carbon emissions and fossil fuel </span><span>reserves, (2) low tracking error relative to the parent index, and (3) low active sector, country and regional biases relative to </span><span>the parent index. The carbon exposure of an issuer is measured in terms of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its </span><span>potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Greenhouse gas emissions of the issuer includes direct greenhouse gas </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>47</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Underlying </span><span>Index uses MSCI ESG Carbon Metrics data provided by MSCI ESG Research Inc. MSCI normalizes for size by dividing the </span><span>annual carbon emissions of the company EVIC of the company, and by dividing the potential carbon emissions from fossil </span><span>fuel reserves of the company by its market capitalization.

Large- and mid‑capitalization companies, </span><span>as calculated by the Index Provider, represent approximately the top 85% of the investable market capitalization of each </span><span>developed and emerging market country included in the Parent Index, as defined by STOXX. Free float market capitalization is </span><span>calculated by multiplying the total market capitalization of a security by a free float factor, as determined by the Index </span><span>Provider, to reflect the market capitalization of the number of shares available in the market (rather than that of the total </span><span>number of shares outstanding). The Underlying Index is composed of small-capitalization equity securities from the Parent </span><span>Index that are selected and weighted using an optimization process designed to maximize exposure to five target factors: </span><span>momentum, quality, value, low volatility and size. The Underlying Index also seeks to mitigate exposure to unintended </span><span>systematic exposures, limit turnover and maintain a level of risk similar to that of the Parent Index.</span></div> <div><span>Index Methodology. </span><span>The momentum score is calculated from the following signals: price momentum, earnings momentum </span><span>and earnings announcement drift (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the difference between a stock’s performance on and immediately following an </span><span>earnings announcement date).</span></div> <div><span>The quality score is calculated from the following signals: gross profitability, share dilution, accruals, changes in net operating </span><span>assets, carbon emissions intensity and greenhouse gas (</span><span>“</span><span>GHG</span><span>”</span><span>) reduction targets. Carbon emissions intensity is based on </span><span>the issuer’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> direct emissions from sources that an issuer owns or controls and </span><span>indirect emissions from the issuer’s purchase of energy) relative to peers in its Industry Classification Benchmark (</span><span>“</span><span>ICB</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>Supersector, as reported by Institutional Shareholder Services (</span><span>“</span><span>ISS</span><span>”</span><span>). The GHG targets signal is based on the robustness of </span><span>an issuer’s GHG reduction targets, including whether they are part of the Science Based Targets initiative (</span><span>“</span><span>SBTi</span><span>”</span><span>) framework; </span><span>this is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG ratings data and SBTi data.</span></div> <div><span>The value score is calculated from the following signals: current book value‑to‑price ratio, dividend yield (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, 12-month </span><span>trailing dividend divided by total market capitalization), earnings yield (i.e., 12-month net income divided by total market </span><span>capitalization), cash flow yield (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> 12-month cash flow divided by total market capitalization) and time series normalized </span><span>cash flow yield over the previous 36 months.</span></div> <div><span>The low volatility score is based on prior 12-month volatility, as calculated by the Index Provider.</span></div> <div><span>The size score seeks to measure an issuer’s market capitalization relative to other companies in the Parent Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider derives a composite score based on a combination of the five factors at the following weights: </span><span>momentum, 27%; quality, 36%; value, 27%; low volatility, 5%; and size, 5%. The composite score is an input to the </span><span>optimization process through which the Index Provider selects securities from the Parent Index and assigns weights.</span></div> <div><span>The optimization process seeks to maximize the overall exposure to the five factors while applying certain constraints, which </span><span>include the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A constituent’s minimum weight is the greater of 0% and its weight in the Parent Index minus 2%.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A constituent’s maximum weight is the lesser of its weight in the Parent Index plus 2% and 20 times its Parent Index </span><span>weight.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The maximum weight for a single issuer is 10% of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The sum of issuer weights that are individually greater than 4.5% must be less than 22.5% of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>55</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, </span><span>the Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market </span><span>indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad </span><span>authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund's total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span><span>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements.

Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice </span><span>of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future </span><span>investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end </span><span>investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment </span><span>company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</span></div> <div><span>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply </span><span>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </span><span>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </span><span>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </span><span>without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>59</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Management</span></div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </span><span>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and </span><span>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</span><span>“</span><span>Independent Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock-advised Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) are organized into one </span><span>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fixed-Income</span><span> Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) and one complex of ETFs (</span><span>“</span><span>Exchange-Traded Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>). Each </span><span>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee </span><span>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists </span><span>of 404 funds as of December 1, 2023. With the exception of Stephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron Wasserman, the </span><span>address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. </span><span>Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o </span><span>BlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United Kingdom. The Board has designated </span><span>John E.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of eleven members, nine of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>67</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight.

BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>83</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock.

In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to, among other things, increase </span><span>or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted </span><span>revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans </span><span>to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this </span><span>conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>86</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>87</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund.

Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>89</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. In instances where BlackRock </span><span>charges a unitary management fee, BlackRock may have a financial incentive to use a BlackRock index that is less costly to </span><span>BlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing </span><span>acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are </span><span>under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured </span><span>that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying service providers out of its fees that it receives </span><span>from the Funds, the benefits of lower fees, including any fee discounts or concessions, or any additional savings, may accrue, </span><span>in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service </span><span>providers to a Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to contractual arrangements with third-party </span><span>service providers to a Fund, or the selection of such providers, particularly in circumstances where BlackRock is negotiating </span><span>on behalf of both funds that have a unitary management fee and those that do not or different service providers have </span><span>different fee structures.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of simultaneous investment management of multiple client accounts by the </span><span>BlackRock’s investment professionals. For example, differences in the advisory fee structure may create the appearance of </span><span>actual or potential conflicts of interest because such differences could create pecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor one </span><span>client account over another.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>90</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC </span><span>participants and/or investor services organizations.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, </span><span>including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending. </span><span> </span><span>To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending </span><span>pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of </span><span>BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Securities Lending Agency Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its </span><span>services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the </span><span>reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to </span><span>and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities </span><span>lending, including custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash </span><span>collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the </span><span>“</span><span>collateral investment fees</span><span>”</span><span>); however, </span><span>BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral </span><span>investment fees a Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, </span><span>redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</span></div> <div><span>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination </span><span>of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be </span><span>subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>98</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and </span><span>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </span><span>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds (including, if applicable, any underlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-traded</span><span> products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of </span><span>owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ </span><span>participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors </span><span>more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, </span><span>such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development </span><span>of technology platforms and reporting systems (</span><span>“</span><span>Education Costs</span><span>”</span><span>).

In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission </span><span>rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares </span><span>funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other </span><span>iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own </span><span>assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may </span><span>benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </span><span>Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries.

Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan </span><span>Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public </span><span>Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, </span><span>TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial </span><span>Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have </span><span>occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </span><span>by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of </span><span>a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing </span><span>methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the </span><span>local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div><span>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </span><span>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </span><span>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </span><span>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., </span><span>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</span></div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>108</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>109</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </span><span>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>DTCC</span><span>”</span><span>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </span><span>referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>Beneficial Owners</span><span>”</span><span>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </span><span>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect </span><span>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors.

Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the </span><span>“</span><span>Fund Deposit,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>which, when combined with a Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective </span><span>investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent </span><span>investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described </span><span>below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of the Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made </span><span>available.</span></div> <div><span>The </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Component</span><span>”</span><span> is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </span><span>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </span><span>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </span><span>Participant purchasing a Creation Unit. Each Fund (except for the iShares MSCI China A ETF) generally offers Creation Units </span><span>partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind.</span></div> <div><span>The iShares MSCI China A ETF’s current policy is to accept cash (which may include the currency in which the underlying </span><span>securities are denominated) in substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind consideration for </span><span>the purchase of Creation Units. The Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the in-kind deposit of a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If the Fund </span><span>elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser’s delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the Cash Component will </span><span>constitute the </span><span>“</span><span>Fund Deposit,</span><span>”</span><span> which will represent the consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Please see the </span><span>Cash </span><span>Purchase Method</span><span> section below and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further </span><span>information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's </span><span>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </span><span>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments </span><span>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </span><span>portion of the Fund Deposit through </span><span>“</span><span>systematic rounding.</span><span>”</span><span> The rounding methodology </span><span>“</span><span>rounds up</span><span>”</span><span> position sizes of </span><span>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum </span><span>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</span></div> <div><span>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for </span><span>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </span><span>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </span><span>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when </span><span>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </span><span>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an </span><span>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </span><span>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</span></div> <div><span>Cash Purchase Method. </span><span> </span><span>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its </span><span>funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified (Creation Units of the iShares MSCI </span><span>China A ETF are generally offered solely for cash, while Creation Units of all other Funds in this SAI are generally offered </span><span>partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or </span><span>full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be </span><span>required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser. </span><span>The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash purchases, as described </span><span>below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, </span><span>execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </span><span>Brokerage </span><span>Transactions</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>117</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant.</span><span>”</span><span> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </span><span>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</span></div> <div><span>Role of the Authorized Participant.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units</span><span> </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized </span><span>Participant</span><span>”</span><span>). Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on </span><span>behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will </span><span>make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the </span><span>NAV of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction </span><span>fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an </span><span>agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. </span><span>Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors </span><span>should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an </span><span>Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional </span><span>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </span><span>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The </span><span>Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available </span><span>to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact </span><span>with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may </span><span>be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </span><span>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash </span><span>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</span></div> <div><span>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </span><span>of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders </span><span>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>118</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders </span><span>to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a </span><span>weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline </span><span>specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The Distributor or its agent, </span><span>in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any </span><span>time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of </span><span>the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if </span><span>accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a </span><span>Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </span><span>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them </span><span>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF may exercise its right to reject any creation order for shares </span><span>of the Fund on any Business Day that is a holiday in the Indian market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market </span><span>and certain other holidays during the settlement cycle for Fund shares in order to protect Fund shareholders from any dilutive </span><span>costs that may be associated with the purchase of Deposit Securities in connection with creation orders on such days.</span></div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. For the iShares MSCI </span><span>China A ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+1 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, one Business Day after trade date). For the iShares </span><span>Breakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets </span><span>ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies </span><span>ETF, iShares Future Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Equity Factor </span><span>ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All </span><span>Country Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF, iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector </span><span>ETF, iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual Work and Multisector ETF, Creation Units are generally issued </span><span>on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+1 or T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the </span><span>circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>119</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer, processing and other transaction costs associated with </span><span>the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged on each Creation Unit created by an </span><span>Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard creation transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount </span><span>shown in the table below regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, but may be reduced by a Fund if </span><span>transfer and processing expenses associated with the creation are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee.</span></div> <div><span>If a purchase consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional transaction </span><span>charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the creation </span><span>transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants </span><span>will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation </span><span>transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial </span><span>intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard creation transaction fee and maximum additional charge (as described </span><span>above):</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security.

In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash </span><span>equivalent of the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the </span><span>same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain </span><span>transaction fees and charges for cash redemptions, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be </span><span>required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution </span><span>Performance Guarantee, as described in the </span><span>Brokerage Transactions</span><span> section of this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Cash redemption proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date </span><span>of redemption or within seven calendar days thereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a cash basis and an Authorized </span><span>Participant has entered into an Execution Performance Guarantee, but the Authorized Participant is unable, as determined by </span><span>BFA in its sole discretion, to execute the market transactions that are the subject of the Execution Performance Guarantee </span><span>due to an extended market holiday that goes over seven calendar days or in certain other situations where all or a portion of </span><span>the transactions are unable to be executed within seven calendar days, then the Fund may pay the full amount of the </span><span>redemption order (or the remaining amount of the redemption order based on the unexecuted portion of the transaction) </span><span>within the original seven calendar day period by using the Fund’s overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand. The </span><span>Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), acting on an agency basis, will subsequently enter into </span><span>one or more separate market transactions when the markets reopen or the trades are otherwise able to be executed through </span><span>which a Fund sells the Fund Securities (or the remaining unsold Fund Securities) subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the </span><span>Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves executions in market transactions at a price </span><span>more favorable than a Fund’s valuation of the Fund Securities as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the </span><span>redemption, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. Specifically, if the </span><span>Authorized Participant is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to the Fund’s valuation </span><span>of the Fund Securities as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant is </span><span>generally required to make the applicable shortfall payment to the Fund.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, if transacting as broker with a Fund in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized Participant may be required to cover </span><span>foreign exchange costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the Brokerage Transactions section of </span><span>this SAI. If the foreign exchange transaction associated with the applicable security trades can only occur upon the </span><span>settlement of a security trade and such trades are unable, as determined by BFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by the </span><span>seventh calendar day after receipt of the Authorized Participant's redemption order, then a Fund may pay within the original </span><span>seven calendar day period the amount due in respect of the redemption order based on the foreign exchange rate as of the </span><span>date of the redemption order by using the Fund’s overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand (in addition to any sales </span><span>proceeds from the executed portion of the original brokerage order) and subsequently enter into one or more separate </span><span>foreign exchange transactions with the Authorized Participant (or a broker-dealer affiliate of the Authorized Participant or a </span><span>third-party broker-dealer engaged through the Authorized Participant), acting on an agency basis, and be subject to a </span><span>guaranteed sales price. If the Authorized Participant achieves execution of the foreign exchange transactions at a price more </span><span>favorable than the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the </span><span>Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. If the Authorized Participant is unable to achieve </span><span>execution of the foreign exchange transactions at a price at least equal to the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation </span><span>applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant is required to make the applicable shortfall </span><span>payment to the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>122</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The standard redemption transaction fee is charged on each Creation Unit redeemed by an </span><span>Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard redemption transaction fee is generally fixed at the </span><span>amount shown in the table below regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, but may be reduced by each </span><span>Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the redemption are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a </span><span>redemption consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional transaction </span><span>charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the redemption </span><span>transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants </span><span>will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order.

Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </span><span>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set </span><span>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> <div><span>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </span><span>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities </span><span>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </span><span>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC </span><span>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </span><span>Participant submitting the redemption request.</span></div> <div><span>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain </span><span>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </span><span>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</span></div> <div><span>For the iShares MSCI China A ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within one Business Day (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>T+1</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>For the iShares Breakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares Core MSCI International </span><span>Developed Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares </span><span>Exponential Technologies ETF, iShares Future Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF, </span><span>iShares Global Equity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon </span><span>Target ETF, iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF, iShares Robotics and </span><span>Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF, iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector ETF, </span><span>deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within two Business Days (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>T+2</span><span>”</span><span>). However, each Fund reserves the </span><span>right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+1 or T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or </span><span>appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle </span><span>redemption transactions on a basis other than T+1 or T+2 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to </span><span>account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the </span><span>last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain </span><span>other circumstances consistent with applicable law. </span></div> <div><span>If neither the Authorized Participant nor the Beneficial Owner on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting has </span><span>appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to </span><span>make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may </span><span>in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its </span><span>redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares </span><span>based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a </span><span>redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Trust's brokerage and other transaction costs </span><span>associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) </span><span>reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund </span><span>Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units (except that, as noted above, Creation </span><span>Units of each Fund generally will be redeemed partially for cash, with the exception of Creation Units for the iShares MSCI </span><span>China A ETF, which generally will be redeemed for cash), in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>124</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market </span><span>holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming </span><span>Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, the Fund may </span><span>delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if the Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as </span><span>practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant’s agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The </span><span>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </span><span>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </span><span>Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </span><span>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </span><span>for related brokerage and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any </span><span>period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an </span><span>emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is </span><span>not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</span></div> <div><span>Custom Baskets.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> A custom </span><span>basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio </span><span>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </span><span>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>125</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </span><span>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under </span><span>Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least </span><span>90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and </span><span>meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual </span><span>gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or </span><span>other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, </span><span>futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net </span><span>income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an established </span><span>securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their income from </span><span>interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each </span><span>Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by cash and cash </span><span>items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes </span><span>of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not </span><span>greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's </span><span>total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any </span><span>one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the </span><span>same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </span><span>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </span><span>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital </span><span>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </span><span>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>126</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </span><span>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </span><span>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> the excess of the aggregate </span><span>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund </span><span>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> <div><span>Excise Tax.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following Funds had net capital loss carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of July 31, 2023, the tax year-end for </span><span>the Funds listed:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in </span><span>excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat </span><span>rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital </span><span>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </span><span>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b).

Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>128</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>129</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </span><span>assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </span><span>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </span><span>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </span><span>more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss </span><span>with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </span><span>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </span><span>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the </span><span>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, </span><span>Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech </span><span>Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </span><span>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, </span><span>Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, </span><span>Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</span><span> </span><span>Substitute </span><span>payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held </span><span>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </span><span>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those </span><span>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </span><span>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date </span><span>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </span><span>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to </span><span>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </span><span>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </span><span>as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span><span>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a </span><span>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>130</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to </span><span>the investment.</span></div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could </span><span>realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the </span><span>tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received </span><span>by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the </span><span>Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion </span><span>income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as </span><span>individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset </span><span>by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </span><span>shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain </span><span>“</span><span>disqualified </span><span>organizations,</span><span>”</span><span> as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a </span><span>charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a </span><span>100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be </span><span>successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT </span><span>may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </span><span>Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </span><span>investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments. </span><span> </span><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.</span><span> currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary </span><span>income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or </span><span>loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the </span><span>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </span><span>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to </span><span>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </span><span>unless a Fund were to elect otherwise.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the </span><span>security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the </span><span>result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed </span><span>distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the Fund’s </span><span>non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their </span><span>deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the </span><span>Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by a </span><span>Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not </span><span>“</span><span>passed through</span><span>”</span><span> for tax purposes will not be available to </span><span>shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a year that the Fund elects to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.</span><span> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </span><span>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of </span><span>non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from </span><span>non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain </span><span>limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned </span><span>pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a </span><span>Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends.

Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in </span><span>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</span></div> <div><span>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified electing fund</span><span>”</span><span> under the Internal Revenue Code, in </span><span>lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </span><span>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be </span><span>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be </span><span>required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </span><span>obtain.</span></div> <div><span>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and </span><span>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and </span><span>would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </span><span>separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </span><span>revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </span><span>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize </span><span>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may </span><span>have to distribute this </span><span>“</span><span>phantom</span><span>”</span><span> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </span><span>4% excise tax.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </span><span>effects of these rules.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>132</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of the </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, the Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or </span><span>qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of </span><span>these rules to their accounts.</span></div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding certain of the </span><span>Funds' participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) </span><span>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </span><span>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </span><span>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span><span>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </span><span>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to </span><span>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </span><span>account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, </span><span>and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. </span><span>estate tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as </span><span>a substitute for careful tax planning.

These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </span><span>are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD Disclosure </span><span>Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>) if such managers market a fund to EU investors. </span></div> <div><span>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </span><span>can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with </span><span>known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of </span><span>“</span><span>depositaries</span><span>”</span><span>; and coverage for professional liability risks. </span></div> <div><span>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an </span><span>‘alternative investment fund manager’ (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFM</span><span>”</span><span>) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For </span><span>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be </span><span>the AIFM. </span></div> <div><span>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, </span><span>rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar </span><span>liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not </span><span>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </span><span>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems </span><span>employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </span><span>employed in respect of the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in the respective countries listed below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF: the U.K.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>iShares MSCI ACWI ETF: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>134</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world.</span></div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the responsibility of the BlackRock Investment </span><span>Stewardship (BIS) team.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In our experience, sound governance is critical to the success of a company, the protection of investors’ interests, and long-term</span><span> financial value creation. We take a constructive, long-term approach with companies and seek to understand how they </span><span>are managing the drivers of risk and financial value creation in their business models. We have observed that well-managed </span><span>companies will effectively evaluate and address risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses, which supports durable, </span><span>long-term financial value creation. As one of many minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot – and does not try to – direct a </span><span>company’s strategy or its implementation.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Shareholders should have the right to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Elect, remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-</span><span>laws.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes </span><span>to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital </span><span>structure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Access sufficient and timely information on material governance, strategic, and business matters to make informed </span><span>decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our view, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps to achieve this balance.</span></div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock monitors and provides feedback to companies in our role as stewards of </span><span>our clients’ assets. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>and business practices that support the ability of companies to deliver long-term financial performance for our clients. We do </span><span>this through engagement with companies, proxy voting on behalf of those clients who have given us authority, and </span><span>participating in market-level dialogue to improve corporate governance standards.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and disclosures, particularly where </span><span>our observations indicate that they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial performance. </span><span>Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how they believe </span><span>their actions are aligned with the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Engagement with companies may also </span><span>inform our proxy voting decisions.</span></div> <div><span>As a fiduciary, we vote in the long-term economic interests of our clients. Generally, we support the recommendations of the </span><span>board of directors and management. However, there may be instances where we vote against the election of directors or </span><span>other management proposals, or support shareholder proposals. For instance, we may vote against management </span><span>recommendations where we are concerned that the board may not be acting in the long-term economic interests of </span><span>shareholders, or disclosures do not provide sufficient information to assess how material, strategic risks and opportunities </span><span>are being managed. Our regional proxy voting guidelines are informed by our market-specific approach and standards of </span><span>corporate governance best practices.</span></div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>While accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets, in our experience, there are </span><span>certain globally-applicable fundamental elements of governance that contribute to a company’s ability to create long-term </span><span>financial value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the </span><span>“</span><span>Principles</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the accepted </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Alongside the Principles and regional voting guidelines, BIS </span><span>publishes our </span><span>engagement priorities</span><span> which reflect the </span><span>five themes</span><span> on which we most frequently engage companies, where </span><span>they are relevant, as these can be a source of material business risk or opportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies set out the </span><span>core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, </span><span>including when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case </span><span>basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We believe that an effective and well-functioning board that has appropriate governance structures to facilitate oversight of a </span><span>company's management and strategic initiatives is critical to the long-term financial success of a company and the </span><span>protection of shareholders’ economic interests. In our view, a strong board can be a competitive advantage to a company, </span><span>providing valuable oversight of and perspectives to management on the most important decisions in support of long-term </span><span>financial performance. As part of their responsibilities, board members have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the </span><span>strategic direction, operations, and risk management of a company. For this reason, BIS sees engagement with and the </span><span>election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities. Disclosure of material risks that may affect a company’s </span><span>long-term strategy and financial value creation, including material sustainability-related factors when relevant, is essential for </span><span>shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively management is identifying, managing, and mitigating </span><span>such risks.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms to support its </span><span>oversight of the company’s strategy and operations consistent with the long-term economic interests of investors. There </span><span>should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how directors engage with and </span><span>oversee management. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in overseeing the </span><span>management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s purpose and strategy.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that its board has fulfilled these corporate governance </span><span>and risk oversight responsibilities, we will consider voting against the election of directors who, on our assessment, have </span><span>particular responsibility for the issues. We assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each </span><span>company’s circumstances, taking into consideration their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term </span><span>financial value creation, and performance. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a </span><span>commitment to acting in the long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Regular accountability through director elections</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual director </span><span>elections allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members and/or hold them accountable for their decisions in </span><span>a timely manner. When board members are not elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect </span><span>developments in the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

We consider the average overall tenure of the board, and seek a balance between the knowledge and </span><span>experience of longer-serving directors and the fresh perspectives of directors who joined more recently. We encourage </span><span>companies to regularly review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated for election </span><span>in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. In our view, the company’s assessment should consider a number </span><span>of factors, including each director’s independence and time commitments, as well as the diversity and relevance of director </span><span>experiences and skillsets, and how these factors may contribute to the financial performance of the company.</span></div> <div><span>Similarly, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence from </span><span>connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. Common </span><span>impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or a subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior, independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to meet with shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to </span><span>explain and contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors, or require additional focus. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board </span><span>forms committees comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in </span><span>audit, director nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special </span><span>transaction, particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> <div><span>When nominating directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual candidates </span><span>so that shareholders can assess the capabilities and suitability of each individual nominee and their fit within overall board </span><span>composition. These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board, as </span><span>well as the particular skill-sets of individual directors, aligns with the company’s long-term strategy and business model. </span><span>Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business and strategy enhance </span><span>the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> when the board advises and oversees management. This position is based on our view </span><span>that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team, and throughout the company – </span><span>leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research has revealed correlations between specific </span><span>dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>1</span><span> In our experience, greater diversity in the </span><span>board room can contribute to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient decisions. Over time, greater </span><span>diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership team, and the workforce more </span><span>broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that better address the needs of the customers and </span><span>communities they serve.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a </span><span>director’s industry experience, specialist areas of expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics </span><span>such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see the most effective boards nominating directors from diverse backgrounds which helps ensure </span><span>boards can more effectively understand the company's customers, employees, and communities. We note that in many </span><span>markets, policymakers have set board gender diversity goals which we may discuss with companies, particularly if there is a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: </span><span>McKinsey</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters,</span><span>”</span><span> May 2022; </span><span>Harvard Business Review</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better,</span><span>”</span><span> September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We encourage boards to aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, while </span><span>recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can take time.</span></div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and note that international </span><span>standards setters, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the International Auditing and </span><span>Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to companies.</span><span>2</span></div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information and internal control frameworks. Moreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, these committees can </span><span>provide oversight of Enterprise Risk Management systems.</span><span>3</span><span> In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the </span><span>quality and reliability of a company’s financial statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit, and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee the audit process and related activities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit or risk committee, should periodically review the </span><span>company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks and exposures identified by management, </span><span>the internal auditors or the independent auditors and management’s steps to address them. In the absence of detailed </span><span>disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>IFRS, </span><span>“</span><span>IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span><span>”</span><span>, June 2023, and IAASB, </span><span>“</span><span>IAASB Launches Public </span><span>Consultation on Landmark Proposed Global Sustainability Assurance Standard</span><span>”</span><span>, August 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership and a core principle of effective governance. Shareholders, as the </span><span>residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting the financial value of the company, and voting rights should </span><span>match economic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, </span><span>they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal at the </span><span>company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current </span><span>structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs </span><span>to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction should clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We find long-term investors like our clients typically benefit when proposed transactions have the </span><span>unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that </span><span>the financial interests of executives and/or board members in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to </span><span>place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to </span><span>support should come from the independent directors, a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have </span><span>been assessed through an independent appraisal process. In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate </span><span>vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our view, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria in compensation structures, but in </span><span>our view, where companies choose to include these components, they should be adequately disclosed, material to the </span><span>company’s strategy, and as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans should encompass </span><span>timeframes that 1) are distinct from annual executive compensation structures and metrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of </span><span>strong financial results over a period of years. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements </span><span>that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their employment. Finally, pension </span><span>contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable, in light of market practices.</span></div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>performance.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We encourage boards to consider building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that companies could clawback </span><span>compensation or require executives to forgo awards when compensation was based on faulty financial statements or </span><span>deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from or the foregoing of the grant of any awards by any senior </span><span>executive whose behavior caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or </span><span>resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. BIS </span><span>may signal concerns through not supporting management’s proposals to approve compensation, where they are on the </span><span>agenda. We may also vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor </span><span>compensation practices or structures.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. As with all risks and opportunities in a company's business model, appropriate </span><span>oversight of material sustainability considerations is a core component of having an effective governance framework, which </span><span>supports durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Long-term investors like our clients can benefit when companies </span><span>demonstrate that they have a resilient business model through disclosures that cover governance, strategy, risk </span><span>management, and metrics and targets, including industry-specific metrics. The International Sustainability Standards Board </span><span>(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2,</span><span>4 </span><span>provide companies with a useful guide to preparing this disclosure. The standards build on </span><span>the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics developed by the </span><span>Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which have converged under the ISSB. We recognize that companies may </span><span>phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB standards over several years. We also recognize that some companies may report </span><span>using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we </span><span>ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>We note that climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from </span><span>various internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data collection and reporting may not line up </span><span>with financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, </span><span>analyze, and report this data to investors.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>That said, to give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and other sustainability-related</span><span> disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting, to the best of their abilities.</span></div> <div><span>Companies may also choose to adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by </span><span>supranational organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </span><span>Further, industry initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best </span><span>practices and disclosures. We find it helpful to our understanding of investment risk when companies disclose any relevant </span><span>global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer </span><span>group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their approach to sustainable </span><span>and responsible business practices. We will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures do not seem adequate in light of the materiality of the business risks.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Climate and nature-related risk</span></div> <div><span>While companies in various sectors and geographies may be affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities, </span><span>the low-carbon transition is an investment factor that can be material for many companies and economies around the globe.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>The objective of </span><span>IFRS S1</span><span> General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information is to require an entity to disclose </span><span>information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making </span><span>decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We seek to understand, from company disclosures and engagement, the strategies companies have in place to manage </span><span>material risks to, and opportunities for, their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, </span><span>including a scenario in which global warming is limited to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of </span><span>1.5°C. As one of many shareholders, and typically a minority one, BlackRock does not tell companies what to do. It is the role </span><span>of the board and management to set and implement a company's long-term strategy to deliver long-term financial returns.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Our research shows that the low-carbon transition is a structural shift in the global economy that will be shaped by changes </span><span>in government policies, technology, and consumer preferences, which may be material for many companies.</span><span>5</span><span> Yet the path to </span><span>a low-carbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different speeds. BIS </span><span>recognizes that it can be challenging for companies to predict the impact of climate-related risk and opportunity on their </span><span>businesses and operating environments. Many companies are assessing how to navigate the low-carbon transition while </span><span>delivering long-term value to investors. In this context, we encourage companies to publicly disclose, consistent with their </span><span>business model and sector, how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through the transition to a low-carbon</span><span> economy. Where available, we appreciate companies publishing their transition plan.</span><span>6</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Consistent with the ISSB standards, we are better able to assess preparedness for the low-carbon transition when companies </span><span>disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based where these are available for their sector, for scope 1 </span><span>and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their targets are consistent with the long-term </span><span>financial interests of their investors.</span></div> <div><span>While we recognize that regulators in some markets are moving to mandate certain disclosures, at this stage, we view scope </span><span>3 emissions differently from scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about </span><span>double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. We welcome disclosures and commitments companies choose to </span><span>make regarding scope 3 emissions and recognize these are provided on a good-faith basis as methodology develops. Our </span><span>publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to climate-related risks and opportunities, the management of nature-related factors is increasingly a component </span><span>of some companies’ ability to generate durable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s </span><span>strategy is heavily reliant on the availability of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related</span><span> risks. We look for such companies to disclose how they manage any reliance and impact on, as well as use of, natural </span><span>capital, including appropriate risk oversight and relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated </span><span>into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related </span><span>risks and opportunities, as well as in our assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary </span><span>provides more information on our approach to natural capital.</span><span>7</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. For many companies, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. In addition to understanding broader </span><span>stakeholder relationships, BIS finds it helpful when companies consider the needs of their workforce today, and the skills </span><span>required for their future business strategy. We are also interested to understand the role of the board, which is well positioned </span><span>to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s strategy and purpose.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock Investment Institute, </span><span>“</span><span>Tracking the low-carbon transition</span><span>”</span><span>, July 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> <div><span>We have observed that more companies are developing such plans, and public policy makers in a number of markets are signaling their intentions to </span><span>require them. We view transition plans (TPs) as a method for a company to both internally assess and externally communicate long-term strategy, </span><span>ambition, objectives, and actions to create financial value through the global transition towards a low-carbon economy. While many initiatives across </span><span>jurisdictions outline a framework for TPs, there is no consensus on the key elements these plans should contain. We view useful disclosure as that </span><span>which communicates a company’s approach to managing financially material, business relevant risks and opportunities – including climate-related </span><span>risks – to deliver long-term financial performance, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> <div><span>Given the growing awareness of the materiality of these issues for certain businesses, enhanced reporting on a company's natural capital </span><span>dependencies and impacts would aid investors’ understanding. In our view, the final recommendations of the </span><span>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures</span><span> may prove useful to some companies. We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may be required </span><span>by regulation, or one of a number of other private sector standards.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies should articulate how they address material adverse impacts that could arise from their business practices and </span><span>affect critical relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the extent appropriate, </span><span>monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse impacts and grievance </span><span>mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within these relationships can </span><span>contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of the </span><span>companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess the effectiveness of the board’s oversight of management and whether investors’ economic interests </span><span>have been protected. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form</span></div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>8</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or similar </span><span>entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting documentation </span><span>from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate how the interests </span><span>of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting mechanisms that </span><span>would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management proposals if our </span><span>analysis indicates that shareholders’ economic interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock </span><span>can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder </span><span>proposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by others.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term financial value creation by that company. We believe it is helpful for companies to disclose the names of the </span><span>proponent or organization that has submitted or advised on the proposal. We consider the business and economic relevance </span><span>of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which our experience indicates it should be addressed. We </span><span>would not support proposals that we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company. </span><span>We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding </span><span>depending on the jurisdiction, while others may make requests that would be deemed illegal in a given jurisdiction.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material business risk that we agree needs to be addressed and the intended outcome is </span><span>consistent with long-term financial value creation, we will look to the board and management to demonstrate that the </span><span>company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis and/or engagement </span><span>indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support shareholder proposals that </span><span>are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management.</span></div> <div><span>We recognize that some shareholder proposals bundle topics and/or specific requests and include supporting statements </span><span>that explain the reasoning or objectives of the proponent. In voting on behalf of clients, we do not submit or edit proposals or </span><span>the supporting statements – we must vote yes or no on the proposal as phrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we vote </span><span>in support of a proposal, we are not necessarily endorsing every element of the proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or </span><span>supporting statement of the proponent. We may support a proposal for different reasons from those put forth by the </span><span>proponent, when we believe that, overall, it can advance our clients' long-term financial interests. We would normally explain </span><span>to the company our rationale for supporting such proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

We may also support a proposal if management is on </span><span>track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate efforts to address a material risk.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or </span><span>senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on </span><span>amendments to BIS regional proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering markets within each respective region. The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Oversight Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock </span><span>investment teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior </span><span>executives with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the Guidelines.</span></div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining </span><span>records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate </span><span>governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important developments in </span><span>the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of </span><span>those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant </span><span>investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</span></div> <div><span>Vote execution</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been authorized to vote on </span><span>behalf of our clients, we carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for </span><span>which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting </span><span>authority based on our evaluation of the alignment of the voting items with the long-term economic interests of our clients, </span><span>in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or </span><span>any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s </span><span>affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </span><span>“</span><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures,</span><span>”</span><span> below).</span></div> <div><span>When exercising voting rights, BIS will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </span><span>relevant market, as well as the Global Principles. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with </span><span>changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by </span><span>the applicable Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude </span><span>that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the </span><span>Guidelines would be in the long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on an assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BIS’ ability to vote such proxies, as well as the </span><span>desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii) </span><span>restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs (including </span><span>but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are </span><span>expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> <div><span>Active portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the </span><span>economic impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing </span><span>views on how to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and </span><span>sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are generally cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> <div><span>Voting Choice</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock offers a Voting Choice program, which provides eligible clients with more opportunities to participate in the proxy </span><span>voting process where legally and operationally viable. BlackRock Voting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier and more </span><span>accessible for eligible clients.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Voting Choice is currently available for eligible clients invested in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and </span><span>Canada that utilize equity index investment strategies, as well as eligible clients in certain institutional pooled funds in the </span><span>U.S., UK, and Canada that use systematic active equity (SAE) strategies. Currently, this includes over 650 pooled investment </span><span>funds, including equity index funds and SAE investment funds. In addition, institutional clients in separately managed </span><span>accounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their investment strategies.</span><span>9</span></div> <div><span>As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third-party policy, or have </span><span>elected to vote shares in accordance with their own policy. Agreements with our clients to allow them greater control over </span><span>their voting, including which policies they have selected, will be treated confidentially consistent with our treatment of similar </span><span>client agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are </span><span>examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock clients who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock business partners or third parties who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock employees who may sit on the boards of public companies held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Significant BlackRock, Inc. investors who may be issuers of securities held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Securities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock investment funds held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, Inc. board members who serve as senior executives or directors of public companies held in Funds managed </span><span>by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>BlackRock has taken certain steps to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts including, but not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to advance our clients’ long-term economic interests in the companies in </span><span>which BlackRock invests on their behalf</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Established a reporting structure that separates BIS from employees with sales, vendor management, or business </span><span>partnership roles.

In such circumstances, the independent third-party </span><span>voting service provider provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote </span><span>such proxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-party voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations </span><span>for shares of BlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an independent third-</span><span>party voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </span><span>the board of directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock Funds</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent third-</span><span>party voting service provider</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In selecting an independent third-party voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: </span><span>independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the economic interest of our clients in </span><span>accordance with the Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the </span><span>assigned recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent third-party voting service </span><span>provider, in part to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global </span><span>Committee appoints and reviews the performance of the independent third-party voting service providers, generally on an </span><span>annual basis.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending</span></div> <div><span>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns while allowing fund </span><span>providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on loan and may </span><span>determine to recall them for voting, as guided by our fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ financial interests. While this </span><span>has occurred in a limited number of cases, the decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending </span><span>program in order to vote is based on an evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential </span><span>securities lending revenue alongside the potential long-term financial value to clients of voting those securities (based on the </span><span>information available at the time of recall consideration).</span><span>10</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and </span><span>Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term financial value to the Fund of voting shares would </span><span>be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in </span><span>our independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to </span><span>clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the U.S., for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting typically </span><span>falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a material </span><span>impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent </span><span>business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date without </span><span>knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for </span><span>the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The voting guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general </span><span>philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. The </span><span>Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the </span><span>individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate how </span><span>BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight </span><span>into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots. As previously discussed, the Guidelines </span><span>should be read in conjunction with the Principles and engagement priorities. Collectively, these </span><span>“</span><span>BIS policies</span><span>”</span><span> set out the core </span><span>elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including </span><span>when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case basis, </span><span>taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>11</span><span> Additionally, we make public our regional </span><span>proxy voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf.
