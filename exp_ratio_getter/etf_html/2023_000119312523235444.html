If a company has more than one eligible share class, the Index Provider will select the one that is a current index constituent if no other share class has a <div>3-month</div> ADTV equal or higher to 1.5 times its <div>3-month</div> ADTV at a given review period or has had higher <div>3-month</div> ADTV for the past eight consecutive quarters.
