Green certification is defined as the percentage of building area owned by an issuer that has a LEED or BREEAM certification, as confirmed by a third-party data provider. </div> <div>Energy usage is defined as the estimated energy usage, measured in kilowatt hours per square foot, of net leasable area owned by an issuer. A third-party data provider estimates energy usage based on factors including building location and size, primary property type, year built and time period of estimation. </div> <div>The carbon emission intensity metric is calculated based on total carbon emissions, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, for the buildings owned by the issuer. A third-party data provider estimates Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, which include both landlord and tenant emissions, for each building based on the types of energy used by similar types of buildings in the geographic area. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from fuels that are used by a building on‑site. Scope 2 emissions are emissions from fuels that are burned off‑site to deliver energy to a building, mainly emissions from electricity use. Scope 3 emissions are other emissions that an issuer generates indirectly, such as emissions from tenants, transportation, waste generation and disposal, supply chain, and purchased products. The emissions are then scaled by the issuer’s enterprise value including cash (i.e., the sum of market capitalization at fiscal year‑end, preferred stock, minority interests, total debt, and cash and cash equivalents). </div> <div>The Underlying Index must have a beta (a measure of volatility relative to the overall market) between 0.7 and 1.3 relative to the Parent Index, using daily returns over the past two years. In addition, the Underlying Index’s country and sector exposure must be within 1% of the Parent Index weight. The minimum weight for an individual constituent is 0.005% of the Underlying Index, and the maximum weight is the lesser of 10% of the Underlying Index or 10 times the constituent’s weight in the Parent Index. </div> <div>At each index review, the sector and country constraints and the green certification and energy usage targets may be relaxed if it is infeasible to achieve all constraints and targets. The first step is to relax the country and sector constraints in 2% increments, up to +/- 10% of the Parent Index. If there is still no solution, the green certification and energy usage targets will be relaxed iteratively in 2.5% increments until a solution is reached. The Underlying Index will be reviewed and reconstituted annually in September, with the business involvement and UNGC controversy screens applied quarterly. </div> <div> </div> <ix:continuation><ix:continuation><div>iShares<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.</div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <div>IS‑A‑SUPP‑ERET‑0924 </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT </div> <div>FOR FUTURE REFERENCE </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
