its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Russell 1000 Telecommunications RIC 22.5/ 45
Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the telecommunications sector of the U.S. equity market, as defined by FTSE Russell (the “Index Provider” or “Russell”). The Underlying Index will
include large- and mid -capitalization companies. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The Underlying Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index which is a float-adjusted
capitalization-weighted index of equity securities issued by approximately the 1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index measures the performance of the broad U.S. equity market, as defined by Russell. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to constrain at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weights of any
single issuer (as determined by Russell) to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the index weight to a maximum of 45%. The weight of one or more securities in the Underlying Index may
exceed these constraints due to fluctuations in market value, corporate actions, or other events that change the index composition between quarterly rebalance dates. </font></p> <p><font size="2">A significant portion of the Underlying Index is expected to be represented by securities of companies in the information technology and telecommunications industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying
Index are likely to change over time. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The last paragraph of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment
Strategies” (and immediately preceding the section entitled “Industry Concentration Policy”) for the Fund shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Underlying Index is sponsored by Russell, which is part of the London Stock Exchange Group and is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the
securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s
