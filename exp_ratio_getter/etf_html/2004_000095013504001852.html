     Effective April 19, 2004, the Trustee has voluntarily agreed to waive an

revised as follows:

*Investors do not pay shareholder fees directly from their investment, but
purchases and redemptions of Creation Units are subject to Transaction Fees
(described below in "A Transaction Fee is Payable for Each Creation and for Each
Redemption of Creation Units"), and purchases and sales of SPDRs in the
secondary market are subject to ordinary brokerage commissions and charges
(described above in "Brokerage Commissions on SPDRs").

**Until April 18, 2005, the Trustee has agreed to waive a portion of its fee to
the extent operating expenses exceed 0.1000%. Thereafter, the Trustee may
discontinue this voluntary waiver policy. Therefore, there is no guarantee that
the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.1000% of the trust's
daily NAV after April 18, 2005. Trust expenses were further reduced by a
Trustee's earnings credit of 0.0013% of the Trust's daily NAV as a result of
uninvested cash balances in the Trust.
