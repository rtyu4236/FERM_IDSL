<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the FTSE Nareit All Residential Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the residential apartments, manufactured homes, healthcare and self-storage real estate sectors of the U.S.
equity market, as defined by FTSE International Limited (the “Index Provider” or “FTSE”). The Underlying Index may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies. Only companies with a full market capitalization
greater than US $100 million by full market capitalization (on the date at which the data for the review are taken) will be included in the Underlying Index. As of March 31, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”). The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear
overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the
Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio
turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by FTSE, which is independent
of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial
markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s
business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities
in which the Fund invests.</div> <div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they
will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction
of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.
Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</div> <div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining
markets.</font></div> <div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font> Companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as REITs or real estate holding and operating companies, expose investors in the Fund to the risks of owning real
estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by
intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could
potentially magnify the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing
activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs.</font></div>
<div>Residential and Residential-Related REIT Sub-Industry Risk. <font>Equity REITs have exposure to residential real estate and certain types of commercial real estate, including properties operated by healthcare providers and self-storage companies. Investments in these
REITs may be affected by the conditions of the rental market, property and rental</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>values, and interest rates, among other things.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the
valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying
Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the
Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or
less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund
(ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial

a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
