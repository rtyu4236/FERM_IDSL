<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 7% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Consumer Staples (Sector) Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is designed to measure the performance of global equities in the consumer staples sector (as determined by S&amp;P Dow
Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)). The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer (as determined by SPDJI) to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying
Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in
the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed
4.50% of the index weight to maximum of 22.50%. Between</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the
end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may
consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is reasonable evidence of common control. The Underlying Index is a subset of the S&amp;P Global
1200<sup>TM</sup>, which is designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. As of March 31, 2021, a significant
portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of
securities of companies in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”)
and the U.S.</div> <div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear
overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the
Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio
turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as
well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for
the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>

<div>comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration
Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more
risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs.
These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious
illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or
global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or
discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities
markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to <font>European Economic Risk.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents

<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing
differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the
Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of
capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market
volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating
the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div> <div>Valuation
Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and
from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In
addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund
shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its portfolio.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>The Fund has not
been categorized under the European Union (“EU”) sustainable finance disclosure regulation as an “Article 8” or “Article 9” product. In addition, the Fund’s investment strategy does not take into account the
criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under the EU sustainable investment taxonomy regulation.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal
risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform
other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>other securities or
instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or
other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities
and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political, sustainability-related or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does
not concentrate its investments.</font></div> <div>Consumer Staples
Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending
and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Household and personal products are particularly sensitive to increased competition, decreased demand due to changes in
consumer preferences and brand diminution. Food products are subject to the risk that raw materials are accidentally or maliciously contaminated or that products are contaminated through the supply chain due to human error or equipment failure. Such
incidents may result in loss of market share and loss of revenue for companies in the consumer staples sector. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced
by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency,
even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without
warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating</font></div> </div>

information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or
from entities with nation-state backing.</div> <div>Cybersecurity
failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to
calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations
of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions,
shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While
the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been
identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in
which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are
subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the EU requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary
controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate
of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of
other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>EU member states and their
trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to,
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather
than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential
uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could
contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the
U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The
political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be
less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Risk.<font> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods,
hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on
the value of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the
Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the
Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA.
BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time
and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its
shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents.
Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those
expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or
corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s
portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

affected the economies of many nations and the global economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or
economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

<td>Market
Volatility.<font> The outbreak has also resulted in extreme volatility, severe losses, and disruptions in markets which can adversely impact the Fund and its investments, including impairing hedging activity to the extent
a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be
impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively affect the credit ratings of some fixed-income securities and their issuers.</font>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future
could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div> <div>Issuer
Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to
decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent
disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be
subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk.</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div> </div>

Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the
Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and
settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be
available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely
to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand
imbalances and other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that
differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares
trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div> <div>Costs of Buying
or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely
incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which
they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market
liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because
of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through
a brokerage account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading
Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s
shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund
will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund
generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax
regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down will bear the
impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is successful
will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,
regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>economies of individual
developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to
territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the
issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of
recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed
country economies.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and
adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain
securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt
service costs may constrain future economic growth.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as
well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust
Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Risk.<font> Certain countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities
markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the
methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Asian Economic
Risk.<font> Many Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced
high inflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic
effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In
particular, China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including
political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed
increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated
with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>investment. To the extent
the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number
and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial
market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can
be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant
to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell
underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where
redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing
to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by
the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Sustainability Risk.<font>
Sustainability risk is an inclusive term to designate investment risk (probability or uncertainty of occurrence of material losses relative to the expected return of an investment) that relates to environmental, social or governance
issues.</font></div> <div>Sustainability risk around environmental
issues includes, but is not limited to, climate risk, both physical and transition risk. Physical risk arises from the physical effects of climate change, acute or chronic. For example, frequent and severe climate-related events can impact products
and services and supply chains. Transition risk – whether policy, technology, market or reputation risk – arises from the adjustment to a low-carbon economy in order to mitigate climate change. Risks related to social issues can include,
but are not limited to, labor rights and community relations. Governance-related risks can include but are not limited to risks around board independence, ownership and control, and audit and tax management. These risks can impact an issuer’s
operational effectiveness and resilience as well as its public perception and reputation, affecting its profitability and, in turn, its capital growth and ultimately impacting the value of holdings in the Fund.</div>
<div>These are only examples of sustainability risk factors, and
sustainability risk factors do not solely determine the risk profile of the investment. The relevance, severity, materiality and time horizon of sustainability risk factors and other risks can differ significantly across funds.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Sustainability risk can manifest itself through different
existing risk types including, but not limited to, market, liquidity, concentration, credit and asset-liability mismatch risk. For example, the Fund may invest in the securities of an issuer that could face potentially reduced revenues or increased
expenditures from physical climate risk (<font>e.g.</font>, decreased production capacity due to supply chain perturbations, lower sales due to demand shocks or higher operating or capital costs) or transition risk (<font>e.g.</font>, decreased demand for carbon-intensive products and services or increased production costs due to changing input prices). As a result, sustainability risk factors may have a material impact on an investment,
may increase volatility, may affect liquidity and may have an adverse impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>The impact of those risks may be higher for funds with
particular sectoral or geographic concentrations. For example, funds with geographic concentration in locations susceptible to adverse weather conditions where the value of the investments in the funds may be more susceptible to adverse physical
climate events, or funds with specific sectoral concentrations, such as investing in industries or issuers with high carbon intensity or high switching costs associated with the transition to low carbon alternatives, may be more impacted by climate
transition risks.</div> <div>All or a combination of these factors
may have an unpredictable impact on the relevant fund’s investments. Under normal market conditions, such events could have a material impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Assessments of sustainability risk are specific to the asset
class and to a fund’s investment objective. Different asset classes require different data and tools to apply heightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and make meaningful differentiation among issuers and assets. To the extent consistent with
the Fund’s investment objective, risks are considered and risk managed concurrently, by prioritizing in part based on materiality and on the Fund’s objective.</div>
<div>The impacts of sustainability risk are likely to develop over
time, and new sustainability risks may be identified as further data and information regarding sustainability factors and impacts become available.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its
affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in
certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>As of March 31, 2021, for
its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following
iShares funds: iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares

of the aggregate net assets over $30.0 billion, up to and including $40.0 billion, plus 0.3078% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $40.0 billion. Based on the assets of the iShares funds listed above as of March 31, 2021, for its
investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.43%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses
in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2021, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $9.49 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest
for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured
notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend

compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same
types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and
BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the
Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other
accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In
addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values,
prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund's
activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from
the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio
securities under the securities lending program.</div> <div>It is
also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability,

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts
less than a Creation Unit.</font></div> <div>Shares of the Fund are
listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the
Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “KXI.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,</div> </div>

<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts
investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not
knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition:
(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired
Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the
exemptive relief obtained by the Trust (when available), the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section
12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on
each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on

service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares
of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div> <div>The
value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the
security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at
their most recent closing price.</div> <div>Generally, trading in
non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of
such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are not readily
available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market
quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or
otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been</div> </div>

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married
and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div> <div>Dividends
will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations,
provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid
on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an
exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a
20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends
from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s</div>

higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares
of the Fund as capital assets.</div> <div>Dividends, interest and
capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or
eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as
“non-U.S.”), generally the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your
share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing
legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide
certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally
offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may
differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The prices
at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Energy Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of companies that S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC
(the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., deems to be part of the energy sector of the economy and that SPDJI believes are important to global markets. The Underlying Index is a subset of the
S&amp;P Global 1200, which is designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of
companies in the energy industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries: Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Canada, Chilé, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index
before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend
securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The
Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.
The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Commodity Risk.<font> The Fund’s investments in certain companies, especially resource extraction and production companies, are sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity markets and to price changes due to trade
relations, and changes in those markets may cause the Fund’s portfolio to lose value.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management
systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service
providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or
increase over time.</font></div> <div>Energy Sector Risk.<font> The market value of securities in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among others, changes in energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and energy
conservation efforts. The energy sector has recently experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month WTI crude
oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>

<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the
Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may
depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of
securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to <font>European
Economic Risk.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>differences between the securities and other instruments held in the
Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of
calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax
treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory
requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error
may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal
risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform
other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Commodity Risk. <font>The energy,
materials, and agriculture sectors account for a large portion of the exports of certain countries in which the Fund invests. Any changes in these sectors or fluctuations in the commodity markets could have an adverse impact on a country’s
economy. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand relationships, weather (including physical changes as a result of climate change),
agriculture, the transition to low carbon alternatives or clean energy, trade, pestilence, political instability, catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction, including price
changes due to trade relations, as well as social or governance factors. Securities of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher
volatility attributable to commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or
other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities
and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political, sustainability-related or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does
not concentrate its investments.</font></div> <div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or
limits on repatriation of such currency, even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change
quickly and without warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users).
Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and
other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business
continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and
remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index
Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among
others: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources (including costs related to the transition to low carbon alternatives or clean
energy); exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. There may also be increased impacts on the value of the investments in the Fund as a
result of geographic concentration in locations where the value of the investments in the Fund may be more susceptible to adverse physical climate events, as well as social and governance factors. Companies in this sector may be subject to
substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small
number of customers, including</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>governmental entities and
utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed
regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental
problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and
could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<font>e.g.</font>, oil and
natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on
the production of crude oil, the energy sector has recently experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month
WTI crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or
in the global economy.</div> <div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers.
Investments in equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities
because common stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the EU requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary
controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate
of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other
EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries,
including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European
countries.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other
unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which
principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The
Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political,
regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws
and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any
other assets in which the Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but
possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely
to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically
sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Index-Related
Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance
that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what
the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA.
BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time
and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the
adequacy and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively
impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other
constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Unusual market conditions may cause
the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean
that constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to
vary from those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market
conditions or corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the
Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried
out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>

Volatility.<font> The outbreak has also resulted in extreme volatility, severe losses, and disruptions in markets which can adversely impact the Fund and its investments, including impairing hedging activity to the extent
a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be
impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively affect the credit ratings of some fixed-income securities and their issuers.</font>

<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management
decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors.
Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in
which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk.</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.

listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or
their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result
in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely
to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand
imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in

Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a
brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are
willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity
and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the
costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a
brokerage account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading
Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s
shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk.<font> The
Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that the Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to the risks
associated with these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund
will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund
generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax
regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down will bear the
impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is successful
will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,
regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed

although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced
strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may
adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic
growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of
commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative
changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental
agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt service costs may constrain
future economic growth.</font></div> <div>The U.S. has developed
increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced
increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities
lending program.</font></div> <div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns.

<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the
methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>A Further
Discussion of Other Risks</div> <div>The Fund may also be subject to
certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous
times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or
instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become
illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund,
and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund
primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.
This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing
increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a

Economic Risk<font>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on
some or all of the North American countries in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a
significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Sustainability Risk.<font>
Sustainability risk is an inclusive term to designate investment risk (probability or uncertainty of occurrence of material losses relative to the expected return of an investment) that relates to environmental, social or governance
issues.</font></div> <div>Sustainability risk around environmental
issues includes, but is not limited to, climate risk, both physical and transition risk. Physical risk arises from the physical effects of climate change, acute or chronic. For example, frequent and severe climate-related events can impact products
and services and supply chains. Transition risk – whether policy, technology, market or reputation risk – arises from the adjustment to a low-carbon economy in order to mitigate climate change. Risks related to social issues can include,
but are not limited to, labor rights and community relations. Governance-related risks can include but are not limited to risks around board independence, ownership and control, and audit and tax management. These risks can impact an issuer’s
operational effectiveness and resilience as well as its public perception and reputation, affecting its profitability and, in turn, its capital growth and ultimately impacting the value of holdings in the Fund.</div>
<div>These are only examples of sustainability risk factors, and
sustainability risk factors do not solely determine the risk profile of the investment. The relevance, severity, materiality and time horizon of sustainability risk factors and other risks can differ significantly across funds.</div>
<div>Sustainability risk can manifest itself through different
existing risk types including, but not limited to, market, liquidity, concentration, credit and asset-liability mismatch risk. For example, the Fund may invest in the securities of an issuer that could face potentially reduced revenues or increased
expenditures from physical climate risk (<font>e.g.</font>, decreased production capacity due to supply chain perturbations, lower sales due to demand shocks or higher operating or capital costs) or transition risk (<font>e.g.</font>,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

carbon-intensive products and services or increased production costs due to changing input prices). As a result, sustainability risk factors may have a material impact on an investment, may increase volatility, may affect liquidity and may have an
adverse impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>The
impact of those risks may be higher for funds with particular sectoral or geographic concentrations. For example, funds with geographic concentration in locations susceptible to adverse weather conditions where the value of the investments in the
funds may be more susceptible to adverse physical climate events, or funds with specific sectoral concentrations, such as investing in industries or issuers with high carbon intensity or high switching costs associated with the transition to low
carbon alternatives, may be more impacted by climate transition risks.</div>
<div>All or a combination of these factors may have an unpredictable
impact on the relevant fund’s investments. Under normal market conditions, such events could have a material impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Assessments of sustainability risk are specific to the asset
class and to a fund’s investment objective. Different asset classes require different data and tools to apply heightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and make meaningful differentiation among issuers and assets. To the extent consistent with
the Fund’s investment objective, risks are considered and risk managed concurrently, by prioritizing in part based on materiality and on the Fund’s objective.</div>
<div>The impacts of sustainability risk are likely to develop over
time, and new sustainability risks may be identified as further data and information regarding sustainability factors and impacts become available.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its
affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in
certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div> </div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured
notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend
the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to
those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment
companies (which may include investment companies that are</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the
Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other
accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In
addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values,
prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund's
activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from
the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio
securities under the securities lending program.</div> <div>It is
also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability,
liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers or employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts
less than a Creation Unit.</font></div> <div>Shares of the Fund are
listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the
Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IXC.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Section
12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the
“Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the
Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more
than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond
the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund
beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust (when available), the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest
in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on
each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the
security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at
their most recent closing price.</div> <div>Generally, trading in
non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of
such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are not readily
available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market
quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or
otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is
imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a
20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends
from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%
of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”), generally the
Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you
may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing
legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide
certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally
offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may
differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The prices
at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Householding.<font> Householding is
an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to</font></div> </div>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 4% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Financials Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of companies that S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices
LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., deems to be part of the financials sector of the economy and that SPDJI believes are important to global markets. The Underlying Index is a subset
of the S&amp;P Global 1200, which is designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by
securities of companies in the financials industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chilé, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities
of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent
investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index
before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend
securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for
exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control
the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector
and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the
specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or
discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from
trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities
and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic
Risk.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these
measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the
securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could
also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may
cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain
pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or
existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value
investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its portfolio.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of
Authorized Participants.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>the market as a whole, to
the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The
Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting
those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency,
even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without
warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and
sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and
other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain
risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to
the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are
subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt
levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations
on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant
adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt
levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to
significantly affect European countries.</font></div> <div>Responses
to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other
unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which
principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The
Fund will face risks</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>associated with the
potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and
could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between
the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The
political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be
less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector.
The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted.</font></div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>impact the value of
investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector are exposed directly
to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and
counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk may
result in significant negative impacts to companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely
affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to
severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and
may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may
negatively impact the Fund.</div> <div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes
or tsunamis, and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of
the Fund.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the
Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the
Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA.
BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time
and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the
adequacy and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

certain emerging markets may have less information available or less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect
constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund
and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those
expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or
corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s
portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An
outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global
economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated
tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future
could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div> <div>Issuer
Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to
decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent
disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be
subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth

<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk.</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary
market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely
to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand
imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in
trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may
contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because</font></div> </div>

buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade
is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund
will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund
generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will
adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund
receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not
benefit from such NAV increase.</div> <div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other
third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits.
BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain
developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security
concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including
labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and
retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative
changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily
indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt service costs may constrain future economic growth.</div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as
well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust
Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the
methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Valuation
Risk.<font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the
Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes
of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result
in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized
Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities
or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as
on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many
Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict
with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of
hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if
these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with</font></div> </div>

political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Australasian Economic Risk.<font> The
economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the energy, agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australasian
economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Because the economies of Australasia are dependent on the economies of Asia and the U.S. as key trading partners and investors, reduction in spending by any of these
trading partners on Australasian products and services, or negative changes in any of these economies, may cause an adverse impact on some or all of the Australasian economies. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can
have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economy.</font></div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk.<font> Custody risk
refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to
complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets.
In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>may reduce the returns of
the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or
instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks
associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when
purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may
be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet
redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be
attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market
volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or
discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div> <div>North American Economic
Risk<font>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or
all of the North American countries in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a
significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Privatization Risk.<font> Some
countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been
privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some
cases,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>due to re-nationalization
of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater
market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found
in more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the
securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant
obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection
considerations. In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to
attract large amounts of foreign trade and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt
liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur
in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause the Fund to miss attractive investment
opportunities.</font></div> <div>Investing in emerging market
countries involves a higher risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging market
countries.</div> <div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or
regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The
capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to
the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>

investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.43%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses
in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2021, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $9.49 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest
for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>

accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or

similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end
investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or
adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other
accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In
addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values,

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts
less than a Creation Unit.</font></div> <div>Shares of the Fund are
listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the
Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IXG.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts
investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not
knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition:
(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired
Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the
exemptive relief obtained by the Trust (when available), the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section
12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

and liabilities held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the
security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at
their most recent closing price.</div> <div>Generally, trading in
non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of
such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are not readily
available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market
quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or
otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Fair value
represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to
extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those
investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV
and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>gains, if any, in excess of
net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to
you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain
threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or
$250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a
20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends
from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>If the
Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s
minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but
will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions
will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%
of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”), generally the
Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you
may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>assets or other positions
(a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances,
offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More
information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share
the same address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 8% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Industrials Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of companies that S&amp;P Dow Jones
Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., deems to be part of the industrials sector of the economy and that SPDJI believes are important to global markets. The Underlying Index is a
subset of the S&amp;P Global 1200, which is designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by
securities of companies in the industrials industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries:
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try
to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in

with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of
the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to
one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the
Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly
and without warning.</div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the
affected region.</div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell
securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities
and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic
Risk.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks</font></div> </div>

<div>through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every
possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These
events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may
cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses,
while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the
index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div> <div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the
value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service
providers.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of
Authorized Participants.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than</font></div> </div>

the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The
Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting
those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency,
even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without
warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and
sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and
other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain
risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to
the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are
subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt
levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations
on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant
adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt
levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to
significantly affect European countries.</font></div> <div>Responses
to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other
unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which
principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The

potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and
could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between
the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The
political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be
less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically
sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where
the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund
would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and
any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those
expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or
corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s
portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the
performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or
trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this
industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending
policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations
and insurance</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An
outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global
economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated
tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

Volatility.<font> The outbreak has also resulted in extreme volatility, severe losses, and disruptions in markets which can adversely impact the Fund and its investments, including impairing hedging activity to the extent
a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be
impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively affect the credit ratings of some fixed-income securities and their issuers.</font>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future
could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div> <div>Issuer
Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to
decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent
disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be
subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market</font></div> </div>

<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>NAV<font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of
many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on
stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to
creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ
significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at
a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div> <div>Costs of Buying or
Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely
incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which
they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market
liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because
of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through
a brokerage account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading
Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s
shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund
will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund
generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax
regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down will bear the
impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is successful
will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,

<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain
developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security
concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including
labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and
retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative
changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental
agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt service costs may constrain
future economic growth.</font></div> <div>The U.S. has developed
increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced
increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the
methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as
on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many
Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict
with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of
hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if
these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social
conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Illiquid
Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed
of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because
the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the
lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with
illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue
to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value,
especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or
for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate
holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in
the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or
regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The
capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to
the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be</div> </div>

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>As of March 31, 2021, for
its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following
iShares funds: iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares

iShares Global Utilities ETF, iShares North American Natural Resources ETF, iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF and iShares Semiconductor ETF. The aggregate management fee is calculated as follows: 0.48% per annum of the aggregate
net assets less than or equal to $10.0 billion, plus 0.43% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $10.0 billion, up to and including $20.0 billion, plus 0.38% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $20.0 billion, up to and including $30.0

BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.43%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund
operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2021, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $9.49 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest
for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>

investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts
less than a Creation Unit.</font></div> <div>Shares of the Fund are
listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the
Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “EXI.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Section
12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the
“Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the
Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more
than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond
the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund
beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust (when available), the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest
in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on
each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the
security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at
their most recent closing price.</div> <div>Generally, trading in
non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of
such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are not readily
available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market
quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or
otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is
imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a
20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends
from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%
of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”), generally the
Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you
may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing
legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide
certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally
offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may
differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>

registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance for the past five years. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost)
on an investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual
Report (available upon request).</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 7% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Utilities (Sector) Capped Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of companies that S&amp;P
Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., deems to be part of the utilities sector of the economy. The Underlying Index is a subset of the S&amp;P Global 1200, which is
designed to measure the performance of large-capitalization stocks from major global markets, as determined by SPDJI. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer (as determined by SPDJI)
to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of
the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%,
and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.5%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that
individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI considers two or more companies as belonging
to the same issuer where more than 20% of all voting shares in a subsidiary are controlled by the same issuer control group.</div>
<div>As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying
Index is represented by securities of companies in the utilities industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the
following countries or regions: Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower
costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as
well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for
the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and
expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities
representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial
markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or
increase over time.</font></div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of
common stocks, which</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and
debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand,
layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on
the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result
in similar impacts.</div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit
rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of
securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to <font>European
Economic Risk.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In addition,
developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>differences between the securities and other instruments held in the
Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of
calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax
treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory
requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error
may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Deregulation, however, may subject utility companies to greater competition and may reduce their profitability.
Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors.</font></div>

table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>On May 3, 2021, the Fund's Underlying Index changed from the
S&amp;P Global 1200 Utilities Index to the S&amp;P Global 1200 Utilities (Sector) Capped Index.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>strategy.
“Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its portfolio.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of
Authorized Participants.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Concentration
Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely
affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other
assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency,
even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without
warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and
sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares,</div>

the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event
of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be
successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or
Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are
subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt
levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations
on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant
adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt
levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to
significantly affect European countries.</font></div> <div>Responses
to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other
unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU</div> </div> <div type="Block">

January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further
discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit,
including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions,
regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws
to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet
fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in
the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate
the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically
sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus
is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality,
accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly
used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to
such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting
from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those
expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or
corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s
portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An
outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global
economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated
tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

Interventions.<font> Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have responded to the outbreak and the resulting economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy
changes, including direct capital infusions into companies and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and lower interest rates. An unexpected or sudden reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase
market volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</font> </td></tr>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future

Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to

in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the
issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk.</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market</font></div> </div>

<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely
to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand
imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in
trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may
contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”;</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based
on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider
spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an
investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade
is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Withholding
Tax Reclaims Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or
when the Fund will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV
of the Fund generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a
change in tax regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down
will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim
is successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is
exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</font></div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,
regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain
developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security
concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including
labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and
retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative
changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental
agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt service costs may constrain
future economic growth.</font></div> <div>The U.S. has developed
increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced
increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities
lending program.</font></div> <div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns.
These situations may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest,</font></div> </div>

maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory
requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error
may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, domestic and international competition, and governmental limitations on rates charged to consumers. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a
lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater competition and may adversely affect their profitability. As deregulation allows utility
companies to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility
companies, but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction projects during
periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or products have been rendered
obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility
companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new
markets, thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks
issued by a utility company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a significant adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have
received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service
providers.</div> <div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous
times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or
instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become
illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund,
and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value,</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>especially in changing
markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs,
the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same
time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the
Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its
affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in
certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured
notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend
the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to
those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment
companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these
Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse
to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could</div> </div> <div type="Block">

transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the
Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from
the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio
securities under the securities lending program.</div> <div>It is
also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability,
liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers or employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for

purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “JXI.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts
investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not
knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition:
(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired
Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain

<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on
each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the
security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at
their most recent closing price.</div> <div>Generally, trading in
non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font>
No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial
owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available
and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is
imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Dividends
received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund
from a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund
may report dividends eligible for a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends
from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%
of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”), generally the
Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you
may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing
legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide
certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences
under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about
the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally
offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may
differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests</div> </div> <div type="Block">

transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Householding.<font> Householding is
an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same
address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are
currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance for the past five years. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost)
on an investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual
Report (available upon request).</div> </div> <div type="Block">

that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 16% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P Developed ex-U.S. Property Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which is a free float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted index
that defines and measures the investable universe of publicly-traded property companies domiciled in developed countries outside of the U.S. The Underlying Index includes<br/> large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies and may change over time.
As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the real estate industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of March 31, 2021, the
Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following countries or regions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index
before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend
securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices
LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information
regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as
the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of
the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market
conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader
securities markets.</div> <div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended
results.</font></div> <div>Market
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local,
regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased
premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which
the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s
quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font> and</font><font> European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font> Companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) or real estate holding and operating companies, expose
investors in the Fund to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic
conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,  utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk
normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially magnify the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to
meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have</font></div>

<div>experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international
relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by
changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Japan<font>.</font><font> The Japanese economy may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative impact on
Japanese securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. In addition, Japan is subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively affect the Fund. Japan’s relations with its neighbors have at times been strained, and strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and
adversely affect the overall Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In
addition, the securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses,
while the Underlying</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities
or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods
when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher
redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services
or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as
on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many
Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict
with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of
hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if
these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social
conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors
including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>controls. This may cause
the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The
Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants).
To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund
shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or
other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities
and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its
investments.</font></div> <div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or
limits on repatriation of such currency, even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change
quickly and without warning.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Cyberattacks may also be
carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users).
Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and
other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business
continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and
remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index
Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are
subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) of the European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt
levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations
on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant
adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. The</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>European financial markets
have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather
than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential
uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could
contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the
U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The
political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be
less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. Recently, the U.K.’s real estate sector has experienced significant volatility and declines in the value of many real estate securities, including real estate funds, REITs and real estate
holding companies. Increased volatility and investor redemption requests in real estate funds may result in the continued decline in the value and liquidity of real estate securities, which may</div> </div>

Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could
adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically
sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period
where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those
expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or
corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the</div> </div>

<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An
outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global
economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated
tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future
could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div> <div>Issuer
Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to
decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent
disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be
subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or
events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,  exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors
through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue
to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards
of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in
other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on the Fund may lead to increased
trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are

the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s
shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors.
In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the
Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s
shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div> <div>Costs of
Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will
likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at
which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and
market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity.
Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments
through a brokerage account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization
Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds
that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic
developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization
companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade
is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s quote</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Risk<font>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund
will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund
generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax
regulation or approach, accruals in the Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written down will bear the
impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is successful
will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Operational
Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits.
BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font>
Companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as REITs and real estate holding and operating companies, expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate
specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many
Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs
and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>. Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high
volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>Equity
REITs Risk. <font>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These REITs are often referred to as “Equity REITs.” Equity REITs invest primarily in real properties and may earn rental income from
leasing those properties. Equity REITs may also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the properties they own. A decline in
rental income may occur because of extended vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising interest rates. Rising interest
rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase the costs of
obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Illiquidity
Risk<font>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in
Real Estate Company shares, which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and,
therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>. Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of
rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers and tenants.
Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</font></div> <div>Loan
Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market
value. In addition to the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition,
transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures in certain of its
properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts, changing
tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments and changes in tax law.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk<font>. Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>tax increases, zoning law
changes, mandated closures or other commercial restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate income and values.</div>
<div>Repayment Risk.<font> The prices of
Real Estate Company securities may drop because of the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real Estate Companies invest do
not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of the Real
Estate Companies to make payments of interest and principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain
developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security
concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including
labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and
retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Japan.<font>
Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, and labor risks, among others. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>. The Japanese
yen has fluctuated widely at times, and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. The Japanese government has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce
the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of
Japan's economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future.
The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected in the past by trade tariffs, other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil and other commodity imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese
economy.</div> <div>Geographic Risk. <font>Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect the
value of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally
accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</font></div>
<div>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing
corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Political Risk<font>. Historically,
Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect the Fund’s investments. In addition, China has become an
important trading partner with Japan. Japan's political relationship with China, however, is strained and delicate. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Japan's
relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern
over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust
Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their
assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>developments. Securities of
small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a
small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of mid- or
large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the
methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Australasian Economic Risk.<font> The
economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the energy, agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australasian
economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Because the economies of Australasia are dependent on the economies of Asia and the U.S. as key trading partners and investors, reduction in spending by any of these
trading partners on Australasian products and services, or negative changes in any of these economies, may cause an adverse impact on some or all of the Australasian economies. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can
have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economy.</font></div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous
times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or
instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become
illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>will continue to be liquid
for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in
changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other
cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings
at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market
for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>LIBOR Risk.<font> The Fund may be
exposed to financial instruments that are tied to London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The Fund’s investments may pay interest at
floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. The Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by the Fund may also reference LIBOR.</font></div>
<div>LIBOR Replacement Risk.<font> As part
of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), discontinued two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. While the FCA is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR
settings, potentially to include USD settings, on a “synthetic” basis, the “synthetic” methodology is not based on panel bank contributions and is not intended to be representative of the interest rates in the underlying
market. The Fund may have investments linked to other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (“EONIA”), which may also cease to be published. Various financial industry groups continue planning for the
transition away from LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain securities and transactions to a new reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is intended to replace USD LIBOR. For example,
at times, SOFR has proven to be more volatile than the 3-month USD LIBOR. Working groups and regulators in other countries have suggested other alternatives for their markets, including the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate
(“SONIA”) in England.</font></div> <div>Neither the
effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. The transition process might lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of new hedges placed against, instruments whose
terms currently include LIBOR. While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>the effectiveness of any
such alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting
provisions in certain existing instruments. Global regulators have advised market participants to cease entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate, and it is possible that investments in LIBOR-based instruments could invite
regulatory scrutiny. In addition, a liquid market for newly issued instruments that use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. There may also be challenges for the Fund to enter into hedging transactions against such newly issued
instruments until a market for such hedging transactions develops. All of the aforementioned may adversely affect the Fund’s performance or NAV.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its
affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in
certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>

<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.48%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order
to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2021, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $9.49 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest
for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's Semi-Annual Report for the period ended September 30.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Jennifer
Hsui, Greg Savage, Paul Whitehead and Amy Whitelaw are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to,

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured
notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend
the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to
those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment
companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these
Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In
addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values,
prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund's
activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from
the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio
securities under the securities lending program.</div> <div>It is
also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability,
liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers or employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for
further information.</div> <div>Shareholder Information</div>

less than a Creation Unit.</font></div> <div>Shares of the Fund are
listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the
Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “WPS.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts
investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not
knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition:

the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust (when available), the registered investment
company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on
each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on
the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund is determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last</div> </div>

exchange or market on which the security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end
funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent closing price.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market
instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of the Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Distributions</div> <div>General Policies.<font> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the
Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated
investment company (“RIC”) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is
imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Dividends
will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations,
provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid
on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an
exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a REIT or another RIC
generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and
distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% “qualified
business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%

non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,
foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders,
comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign
financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing
legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide
certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div> </div>

capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal
Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</font></div> <div>The

<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized
participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of
a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash
representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund generally
offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may
differ and the Fund may accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>To the
extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any
securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an
Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>

an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same
address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are
currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an “Underlying
Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at
their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (including any
portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities” or “Creation Basket”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash
Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”)
(each a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are</div> </div>

permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of
Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to

and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the
Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month
period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;
(iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing
Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively
managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of
the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>
<div>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain
instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF
and iShares Semiconductor ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New York Mellon (“BNY”), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The
syndicated line of credit may be used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</font></div>
<div>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit may be
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. As part of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), discontinued two USD LIBOR
settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be
published after June 30, 2023. While the FCA is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings, potentially to include USD settings, on a “synthetic” basis, the “synthetic” methodology is not based on panel bank
contributions and is not intended to be representative of the interest rates in the underlying market. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if LIBOR ceases to be published or representative before the termination of the credit agreement,
LIBOR would be replaced under the terms of the credit agreement by a variable rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s
portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh
the current reduced return.</div> <div>Certain types of borrowings
by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants
would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of
outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A
currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon
by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon exchange rate and the
market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified future
time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures contracts will be maintained. Certain of
the Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forwards, non-deliverable
currency forwards and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for
speculative purposes.</font></div> <div>Foreign exchange
transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and prices,
can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by
foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or
correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience
losses if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Growth ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF intend to be diversified in approximately the same proportion as their Underlying Indexes are diversified.
The iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Growth ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF may become non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a

Russell Top 200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF or iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF crosses from diversified to non-diversified status due solely to a change in its relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of
its Underlying Index. The Funds disclose their portfolio holdings and weightings at www.iShares.com. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval. However, while the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Growth ETF, iShares
Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF are classified as “diversified,” under applicable no-action relief from the SEC staff, the funds may become
non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of their Underlying Indexes and such a change does not require shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum
distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment
objectives.</div> <div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities
Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may
enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from
the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures
contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon
termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>contract more or less
valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s
existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct
investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the
option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents
the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the futures contract.</div>
<div>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on
a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the
underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put
options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are
traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is
no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out
Events”).</div> <div>Investments in futures contracts and
other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to
its obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least
equal to the Fund’s daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value (<font>i.e.</font>,
the value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the futures
contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time
by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such
instruments more expensive.</div> <div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's
total</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing dividends paid on securities
loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received
on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>
 Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the
“Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has
appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a “highly liquid
investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The Liquidity Rule defines
“liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is
determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as
defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities.<font>
 Certain Funds purchase publicly-traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American Depositary Receipts
(“ADRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) and European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”) (collectively, “depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust
issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust
company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that
evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use
in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the world.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Depositary
receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to additional
risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency risk and liquidity
risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the shareholder benefits that come from
investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</div> <div>Investing
in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of
expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital.
Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product
(“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”) or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with
respect to the Funds.</div> <div>The iShares Biotechnology ETF,
iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Europe ETF, iShares Factors US Value Style ETF, iShares Micro-Cap ETF, iShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF,
iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF, iShares Residential and Multisector Real Estate ETF, iShares Russell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF, iShares Russell 2000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF,
iShares Russell 3000 ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF and iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”)
may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term “underlying fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may
include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), business development companies, and investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of
the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff
issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool
operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for the Funds
to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps,
currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through September 1, 2022. Implementation of the
margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as
a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>As a result
of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, each Fund is currently required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable
derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection
with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under
the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on
cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div> <div>On October 28, 2020,
the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“Rule 18f-4”). The Funds will be required to implement and comply with Rule 18f-4 by August 19, 2022. Once implemented, Rule 18f-4 will
impose limits on the amount of derivatives a fund can enter into, eliminate the asset segregation framework currently used by funds to comply with Section 18 of the 1940 Act, treat derivatives as senior securities and require funds whose use of
derivatives is more than a limited specified exposure amount to establish and maintain a comprehensive derivatives risk management program and appoint a derivatives risk manager.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to
repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by
the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally
strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund's exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a value
equal to or greater than the Fund's obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional
securities.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Securities of
Investment Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in
registered investment companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company;
and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies,
including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and
expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral
received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of
the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that
may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including
government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (“CDs”), bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions;
(iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc., “F-1” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or
“A-1” by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc. (S&amp;P Global Ratings), or if unrated, of comparable quality as
determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of
not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations
of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time
deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with
international transactions.</font></div> <div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party
agrees to make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund
receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an
aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including
currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for the iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp; P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400
Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF and iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF, total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for difference or “CFDs”). The use of swaps is a highly specialized
activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>Tracking Stocks.<font>  A
tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or operating division within a larger company and is designed to “track” the performance of such business unit or division. The tracking
stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the same rights
as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>General
Considerations and Risks</div> <div>A discussion of some of the
principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding
that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of preferred or common stocks in general, and other factors that
affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce
a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk. <font> Custody
risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make
trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of
their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In
general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed
markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted
by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to
recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for
compensation.</font></div> <div>Dividend Risk.<font>  There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over
time.</font></div> <div>Illiquid Investments Risk.<font>  Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current
market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out
in the Liquidity Program as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected
prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font></div>
<div>LIBOR Risk. <font> A Fund may
be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to LIBOR to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s investments may pay interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to
interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a Fund may also reference LIBOR.</font></div>
<div>LIBOR Replacement Risk.
<font> As part of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), discontinued two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication on
December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. While the FCA
is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings, potentially to include USD settings, on a “synthetic” basis, the “synthetic” methodology is not based on panel bank contributions and is not intended to be
representative of the interest rates in the underlying market. A Fund may have investments linked to other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (“EONIA”), which may also cease to be published. Various
financial industry groups continue planning for the transition away from LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain securities and transactions to a new reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”),
which is intended to replace USD LIBOR.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>In June
2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which includes various private-market participants working with the Federal Reserve, announced its selection of the new SOFR, which is intended to be a broad measure of secured overnight U.S. Treasury
repo rates, as its recommendation for an appropriate replacement for USD LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR in 2018, and it has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. At times,
SOFR has proven to be more volatile than the 3-month USD LIBOR. Working groups and regulators in other countries have suggested other alternatives for their markets, including the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (“SONIA”) in
England.</div> <div>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition
process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. The transition process might lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of, new hedges placed against, instruments whose terms currently include LIBOR.
While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such
alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting
provisions in certain existing instruments. Global regulators have advised market participants to cease entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate, and it is possible that investments in LIBOR-based instruments could invite
regulatory scrutiny. In addition, a liquid market for newly issued instruments that use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. Instruments with fallback provisions (<font>i.e.</font>, contractual
provisions specifying the trigger events for a transition to a replacement rate) to facilitate the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may also include adjustments that do not adequately compensate the holder for the different
characteristics of the alternative reference rate. As a result, the fallback provision causes a value transfer from one party to the instrument to the counterparty. Because the usefulness of LIBOR as a benchmark could decline during the transition
period, these and related adverse effects could occur with respect to particular LIBOR settings as they are phased out. There may also be challenges for a Fund to enter into hedging transactions against such newly issued instruments until a market
for such hedging transactions develops. The effect of any changes to, or discontinuation of, LIBOR on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, (1) existing fallback or termination provisions in individual contracts and the potential
renegotiation of existing contracts and (2) whether, how, and when industry participants develop and adopt new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products and instruments. A Fund's investments may also be tied to other interbank
offered rates and currencies, which may face similar issues. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform the same as LIBOR because the alternative
reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component in the rate calculation. Alternative reference rates generally reflect the performance of the market for U.S. Treasury securities, which are secured by the U.S. Treasury, and not the
interbank lending markets. Therefore, in the event of a credit crisis, floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those instruments using a rate indexed to the interbank lending market. In
addition, legislation may affect the transition of LIBOR-based instruments by permitting trustees and calculation agents to transition instruments with no LIBOR transition language to an alternative reference rate selected by such agents. Such
legislation, which has been enacted in some jurisdictions, generally includes safe harbors from liability, meaning that a Fund may have limited recourse if the alternative reference rate does not fully compensate the Fund for the transition of an
instrument from LIBOR. All of the aforementioned may adversely affect a Fund’s performance or NAV.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk. <font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by a Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that are closed when the securities exchange on which a Fund’s shares trade is open, there are
likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a
Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations may result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA
and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively impact the
Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel and
resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to
disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
occurrence or effects.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Derivatives.<font>  A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or
an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options, CFDs (for the
iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF and iShares
S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF) and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in
derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve
the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the
derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a
Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate
gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying
security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Equity Securities.<font>
 An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of stock
markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to increases and decreases in
value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular investors or groups of investors (for example,
retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or significant “short” positions taken by institutional investors). Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt
obligations because common stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically
have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock
price to decline.</font></div> <div>The iShares Preferred and
Income Securities ETF invests a significant portion of its assets in preferred stock, although all of the Funds may invest in preferred stock. A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically encountered by
investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the
value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks may be sensitive to changes in the value of the
issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer may default (<font>i.e.</font>, fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred
stock or scheduled interest payments on other obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An
issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market
volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate based on market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average
yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause a decrease in the yield of a Fund that invested in the preferred stock.</div>
<div>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are
listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend</div> </div>

make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund’s shares will be adversely
affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are wide.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In
the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily
margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered stock index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they
invest.</div> <div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by
a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy
of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the
daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little
or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. <font> An investment in any of the Funds that invest, directly or indirectly, in non-U.S. equity securities involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges.
These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in
countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home
country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions
between various currencies. Investing in any of these Funds also involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include
generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of
funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization;

Investing in Large-Capitalization Companies. <font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be
more mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared to smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities
markets.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Micro-Capitalization
Companies. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of micro-capitalization companies. Micro-capitalization companies may have limited operational histories and new or unproven product lines, or may have
product lines that are still in development. These companies may be more vulnerable than larger companies to key personnel losses due to reliance on a smaller number of management personnel. Micro-capitalization companies may have limited financial
resources and little or no access to additional credit and therefore may be more susceptible to market down turns or rising credit costs than larger, more established companies. Share prices of micro-capitalization companies may be more volatile
than those of larger companies and therefore a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than the share prices of funds that invest a larger percentage of assets in shares issued by small-, mid-, or large-capitalization companies. The shares of
micro-capitalization companies may be thinly traded and may be at risk for delisting from a securities exchange, making it difficult for a Fund to buy and sell shares of a particular micro-capitalization company. In addition, there may be less
public information available about these companies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mid-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a
larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments,
and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it more difficult for the Funds to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Small-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies, and, therefore, a Fund's share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a larger percentage of
their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies to adverse
business and economic developments. The stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Funds to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than
larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization
companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Non-U.S. Preferred Stock. <font> A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred
stock’s market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert
the preferred stock into common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks can be sensitive to changes in the value of the issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may
deteriorate or the issuer may default (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other
obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally
not under any obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will
fluctuate based on market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause
a decrease in the yield of a fund that invested in the preferred stock. Also, non U.S. preferred stock may have different rights or privileges than those commonly associated with U.S. preferred stock. In addition to the risks listed above, investors
in non U.S. preferred stock may experience difficulty or uncertainty in determining and enforcing their rights related to preferred stock.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of Swap
Agreements.<font>  The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap
counterparty will default on its obligations to pay a Fund and the risk that a Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement. If such a default occurs, the parties will have contractual remedies pursuant
to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the Fund’s
obligation to its counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, leverage risk and hedging risk.</font></div>
<div>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin
(comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Initial margin requirements are in the process of being phased in, and a Fund may be subject to such requirements as early as September 2021.
These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.
<font> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at
all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences
for a Fund.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>   Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military
involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent
years, and there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also
developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has
recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this
region.</div> <div>Certain governments in this region administer
prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control
many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China
and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse</div> </div> <div type="Block">

developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with
certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily
dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative
impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Canada.
<font> The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading and investment partner, and the Canadian economy is significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total two-way merchandise trade between the U.S. and Canada has more than doubled. Any downturn in U.S. or Mexican economic activity is likely to have an adverse impact
on the Canadian economy. Political developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on or around
July 1, 2020, could have an adverse impact on Canadian securities. The Canadian economy is also dependent upon external trade with other key trading partners, specifically China and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). As a result,
Canada is dependent on the economies of these other countries. In addition, Canada is a large supplier of natural resources (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, oil, natural gas
and agricultural products). As a result, the Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. <font> The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and political
instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive
to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain
countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values
and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition,
certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and the Venezuelan
government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage
to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic
driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their
perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that
interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last
few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the
economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain
commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed
countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among
others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. <font>  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity
and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and
regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v)
local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro
payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation
against companies and investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to
be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure
and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in
the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced
liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or
in order to meet redemption requests.</div> <div>Many emerging
market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be
weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>countries in the past have
expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax
policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have significant
operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union (the “EU”). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the
“eurozone”) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may
significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the
eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners.
Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European
financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to,
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute “capital controls.” Countries may use
these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of
that country’s debt and sellers of credit</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>default swaps linked to
that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected the value and
exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central
banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings
by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The
impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.  The U.K. left the EU
(“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including
financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. A Fund faces risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences
that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global
political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K.
determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of
Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years,
and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K.
continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly
strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by
disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and
significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value
and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing
in Japan. <font> Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.<br/> </font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of
Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the
future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. Japan
is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese economy.<br/> </font></div>
<div>Political Risk<font>. Historically,
Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has become an
important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.<br/>
</font></div> <div>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing
corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.<br/> </font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Currency
Risk<font>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to
attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.<br/> </font></div>
<div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an
aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to
meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>. Natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk.<font> Japan's
relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern
over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly reliant
on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As global
demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised
and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, including some of the largest companies in the country.
Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in the Fund's
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the
earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and
financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its
rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Substantial
limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental
approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with
other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern
countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of
the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has
increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020,
could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on
the value of certain securities held by a Fund.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in the United Kingdom.<font>  Investment in U.K. issuers may subject a Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K. economy relies heavily on the
export of financial services to the U.S. and other European countries. A prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the U.K.’s economy. In the past, the U.K. has been a target of terrorism. Acts of
terrorism in the U.K. or against U.K. interests abroad may cause uncertainty in the U.K. financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in
Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially left the EU (“Brexit”), subject to a transitional period that ended December 31, 2020. The U.K. and
EU reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the
U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund faces risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in
exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial
markets. Brexit has led to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of
Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may
experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value or
subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to</font></div> </div>

future trading relationships. Recently, the U.K.'s real estate sector has experienced significant volatility and declines in the value of many real estate securities, including real estate funds, real estate investment trusts (“REITs”)
and real estate holding companies. Increased volatility and investor redemption requests in real estate funds may result in the continued decline in the value and liquidity of real estate securities, which may impair the ability of a Fund to buy,
sell, receive or deliver those securities.</div> <div>U.S. Economic
Trading Partners Risk. <font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions
of such countries may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may
have a material adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may
have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Aerospace and Defense Industry. <font> The aerospace and defense industry can be significantly affected by government defense and aerospace regulation and spending policies. The aerospace industry in particular has recently been affected by adverse
economic conditions and consolidation within the industry.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. <font> The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may be, at times, excess
capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. government, while others
formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased pension
liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. Companies in
the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of
exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and
product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental
policies.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Biotechnology
Industry. <font> Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that
intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology
industry spend heavily on research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly. The risks of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a
result of managed care pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent losses during the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to regulatory
approval processes or regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology companies may be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability claims.
Companies involved in the biotechnology industry may be subject to extensive government regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among other foreign and
domestic regulators. Such regulation may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product development and approval of products.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the
capital goods industry depend heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening
demand, worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by
changes in interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chemicals Industry. <font> The success of companies in the chemicals industry can be significantly affected by intense competition, product obsolescence, raw materials prices, and government regulation. As regulations are developed and
enforced, chemicals companies could be required to alter or cease production of a product, pay fines, pay for cleaning up a disposal site or agree to restrictions on their operations. In addition, chemicals companies may be subject to risks
associated with production, handling, and disposal, as some of the materials and processes used by these companies involve hazardous components.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Clean Energy Sub-Industry. <font> Many clean energy companies are involved in the development and commercialization of new technologies, which may be subject to delays resulting from budget constraints and technological difficulties. Clean energy
companies may be highly dependent upon government subsidies and contracts with government entities, and may be negatively affected if such subsidies or contracts are unavailable. Clean energy companies may depend on the successful development of new
and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual
property rights may adversely affect the profitability of clean energy companies. In addition, seasonal weather conditions, fluctuations in supply of, and demand for, clean energy products, changes in energy prices, international political events,
the success of project development and change in government regulatory policies may cause fluctuations in the performance of clean energy companies and the prices of their securities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Commercial and Professional Services
Industry. <font> The success of commercial and professional service providers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, availability of
qualified personnel and corporate demand. The commercial and professional services industry depends heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the commercial and professional services industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also
have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div> <div>Risk
of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. <font> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment
industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a
variety of services and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be
affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting
demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the
communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </font></div>

is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business
of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The communications services industry can also be significantly affected
by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of
new products, lack of standardization or compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit
substantial capital to meet</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>increasing competition,
particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</div>
<div>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are
generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited
availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.
Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S.
companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </div>
<div>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be
significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted
individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for
media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office products, clothing and
textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods
industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods
industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and
litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition,
which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry. <font> The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and
international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the consumer services industry may be
subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory
action. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer service providers.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer
preferences, and production spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For
instance, government regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely
affected by the adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate
in response to a number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather
conditions. Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> <div>The energy sector is cyclical and is
highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices
have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential
limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of
certain crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims.
Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in
addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by governmental
agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may materially adversely affect
the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Most
financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant
adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the
companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial
company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk
and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and
interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on
currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</div> <div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan
associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types
of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the
availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and
counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the financial services companies. Financial services companies may have
significant exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other companies with exposure to the same borrower or
counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse
cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative
perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain
financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial
companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased government intervention. In addition, there is no
guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>result in price
discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of
competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the
opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or
technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or
laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to
healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be
enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Home Construction Industry. <font> The home construction industry may be significantly affected by changes in government spending, zoning laws, economic conditions, interest rates, commodity prices, consumer confidence and spending, taxation,
demographic patterns, real estate values, overbuilding, housing starts, and new and existing home sales. Rising interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability to consumers, increasing foreclosure rates or increases in the costs of owning a home
could reduce the market for new homes and adversely affect the profitability of home construction companies. Different segments of the home construction industry can be significantly affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events
such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts. Home construction companies may lack diversification, due to ownership of a limited number of properties and concentration in a particular geographic region or property type.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Hotel &amp; Lodging REITs Sub-Industry.
<font> Hotel and lodging properties are management and labor intensive and particularly susceptible to the impact of general and local economic conditions. Unlike other types of properties, to meet competition in the
industry, to maintain franchise standards, or to maintain economic values, continuing expenditures must be made for modernizing, refurnishing, and maintaining existing facilities prior to the expiration of their anticipated useful lives. If such
expenditures are not made, the value and profitability of the hotels may be diminished. In addition, inflationary pressures could increase operating expenses of the hotels, including energy costs, above expected levels, and have secondary effects
upon occupancy rates in such hotels by increasing the expense or decreasing the availability of means of travel. All of the factors noted above may contribute to producing operating results of wider variation than for other types of
properties.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials
Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products
in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may affect the
performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component
of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition
of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the
industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and
oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of
resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction,
unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than
the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Information
technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the
information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks are heightened for
information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> <div>Operations
Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest
rates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Inflation
Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge
users of its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The
stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
transportation industry group.</font></div> <div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Insurance
Industry. <font> The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing
competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Life Science and Tools Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the Life Science and Tools Industry may be affected by limited product focus, rapidly changing technology, product development costs, product liability risks, extensive government
regulation, intellectual property rights, and intense competition, any of which may have a material adverse effect on securities prices of a company in which the Fund has invested.</font></div>
<div> Cost containment measures already implemented by the
federal government, state governments and the private sector have adversely affected certain sectors of companies related to healthcare. If not repealed, the continued implementation or expansion of the ACA may create increased demand for healthcare
products and services but also may have an adverse effect on some companies in the life sciences and tools industry. Increased emphasis on managed care in the United States may put pressure on the price and usage of products sold by life sciences
and tools companies in which the Fund may invest and may adversely affect the sales and revenues of these companies. In addition, the restructuring or repeal of the ACA may result in lower utilization of life science and tools products and services.
A reduction in the research budget of the National Institutes of Health may also result in reduced annual research outlays and adversely impact the demand for life science and tools products and services.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources,
technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. Companies in the materials
sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are
heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Medical Equipment Industry. <font> Many companies in the medical equipment industry are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the medical
equipment industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims as well as competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some
medical equipment companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the
medical equipment industry are subject to regulatory approvals, and the process of obtaining such approvals is long and costly.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts. <font> Mortgage REITs lend money to developers and owners of properties and invest primarily in mortgages and similar real estate interests. The mortgage REITs receive interest payments from the owners of the mortgaged
properties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the credit risk of the borrowers to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>whom they extend funds.
Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not be able to make timely interest and principal payments on the loan to the REIT. Mortgage REITs also are subject to the risk that the value of mortgaged properties may be less than the amounts owed
on the properties. If a mortgage REIT is required to foreclose on a borrower, the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed to the mortgage REIT.</div>
<div> Mortgage REITs are subject to significant interest rate
risk. During periods when interest rates are declining, mortgages are often refinanced or prepaid. Refinancing or prepayment of mortgages may reduce the yield of mortgage REITs. When interest rates decline, the value of a REIT’s investment in
fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to decline. In addition, rising interest rates generally increase the costs of
obtaining financing, which could cause the value of a mortgage REIT’s investments to decline. A REIT’s investment in adjustable rate obligations may react differently to interest rate changes than an investment in fixed rate obligations.
As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically, yields on a REIT’s investment in such loans will gradually align themselves to reflect changes in market interest rates, causing the value of such investments to
fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.</div>
<div> Mortgage REITs typically use leverage (and in many
cases, may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a REIT’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates, increased interest rate volatility, downturns in the economy and reductions
in the availability of financing or deterioration in the conditions of the REIT’s mortgage-related assets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Natural Resources Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the natural resources industry can be affected by worldwide energy prices, limits on exploration, and production spending. Companies in the natural resources industry are affected
by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural resources industry could be adversely affected by commodity price
volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. Companies in the natural resources industry may be adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological developments, and labor
relations.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas
Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas
production and conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such
services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in
relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may
significantly impact companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in
emerging markets. In addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price
competition. A significant portion of their revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil Equipment and Services
Sub-Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending. Companies in the oil equipment and
services sub-industry may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may be at risk for environmental damage claims and other types of litigation. Companies in the oil
equipment and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, imposition of import controls and increased competition. Companies in the oil equipment and services
sub-industry may be adversely affected by oil deposits, technological developments and labor relations. Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by government regulation and intervention, negative perception
and world events in the regions that the companies operate (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the
imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may have significant capital investments in, or engage
in transactions involving, emerging market countries, which may heighten these risks.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Investing in the Pharmaceuticals Industry. <font> Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting.
The profitability of some companies in the pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market
developments. Many new products in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates. The process of obtaining government approvals may be long and costly. Many companies in the pharmaceuticals
industry are heavily dependent on patents and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical industry may be subject to extensive
litigation based on product liability and similar claims.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Producer Durables Industry. <font> The producer durables industry includes companies involved in the design, manufacture or distribution of industrial durables such as electrical equipment and components, industrial products, and housing and
telecommunications equipment. These companies may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies and politics, consolidation, and excess capacity. Companies in the producer durables industry face intense competition, which may have
an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the producer durables industry may be strongly affected by changes in consumer demands, spending, tastes and preferences. Companies in the producer durables industry may be
dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Producer durables companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, these
companies may be significantly affected by other factors such as economic cycles, rapid technical obsolescence, government regulations, labor relations, delays in modernization, overall capital spending levels and product liability
lawsuits.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate
Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively,
“Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and
operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some
risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>Distressed
Investment Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves
a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the
securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk.<font> Investing
in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and
principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company.
Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial restrictions or
environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to
liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a
holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S.
Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the
REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains
its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. Because REITs often do
not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise provided to
you.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Residential and
Residential-Related REIT Sub-Industry. <font> The Residential and Residential-Related REIT Sub-Industry consists of REITs with exposure to residential real estate and certain types of commercial real estate that
complements residential real estate, including properties operated by healthcare providers and self-storage companies. In</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>addition to the risks
related to REITs generally, investments in these REITs are subject to additional subsector-specific risks. Residential real estate may be affected by unique supply and demand factors that do not apply to other REIT sub-sectors. In addition, certain
investors may already have exposure to residential real estate through ownership of a primary residence or direct ownership of rental property. The value of healthcare-focused REITs may be affected by changes in federal or state regulation of
healthcare providers and reimbursement rates to healthcare providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other public or private health insurance plans. Unlike less specialized commercial real estate, when tenants vacate healthcare-related properties, the
ability of property management to find replacement tenants may be impaired by the properties’ specialized healthcare uses. Investments in self-storage REITs are subject to changes in demand levels for self-storage. In addition, self-storage
operators may be liable for unplanned environmental and hazardous waste compliance costs associated with operating self-storage locations.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry. <font> The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. Companies in the retail
industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public perceptions. Companies in the
retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property
rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Semiconductor Industry. <font> The Fund invests in semiconductor companies, which face intense competition, both domestically and internationally; such competition may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have
limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of semiconductor companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and
competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on patent and
intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory
scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while
all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a
material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div> <div>Risk
of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental
regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the
area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition,
particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network
security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Investing in the Transportation Industry. <font> Companies in the transportation industry may be adversely affected by changes in the economy, increases in fuel and operating costs, labor relations, technology
developments, exchange rates, insurance costs, industry competition and government regulation. Companies in the transportation industry are also affected by severe weather events, mass casualty accidents or environmental catastrophes, acts of
terrorism and other similar events that target or damage transportation infrastructure or vessels, war or risk of war, widespread disruption of technology systems and increasing equipment and operational costs. Such global or regional events and
conditions may adversely affect the operations, financial condition and liquidity of companies in the transportation industry and cause insurance premiums to increase dramatically or result in insurance coverage becoming unavailable for certain
business lines or assets. Securities of companies in the transportation industry are generally cyclical and occasionally subject to sharp price movements.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on
both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies
for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing
proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote
proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated
person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident
shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client
responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the
dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div> </div>

<div>Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes</div>
<div>Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes are provided
below.</div> <div>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the
iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed investment concepts and strategies that could be
considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted such indices using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole
discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying
index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to
other communications with the index provider.</div> <div>The Dow
Jones Indexes</div> <div>Issue Changes.<font> Each Underlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced quarterly to maintain accurate representation of the market segment represented by the Underlying Index. Securities that are removed from an Index between reconstitution
dates are not replaced.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining the Underlying Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for additions and deletions to each Underlying Index, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due
to restructuring and spin-offs.</font></div> <div>Weighting.<font> The component stocks are weighted according to the float-adjusted market capitalization. The impact of a component’s price change is proportional to the issue’s total market value, which is the share price
multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Each Underlying Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. Each of the Underlying Indexes
(subject to any applicable capping as described below) is a free-float adjusted market capitalization-weighted index, so the impact of a component’s price change is proportional to the component’s free-float adjusted market value, which
is the share price multiplied by the number of float-adjusted shares outstanding. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“SPDJI”) defines the free-float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for
purchase in the public equity markets by investors. In practice, limitations on free-float available to investors include: cross ownership (shares that are owned by other companies), ownership by governments (central or municipal) or their agencies,
certain substantial levels of private ownership (by individuals, families or charitable trusts and foundations), and restricted shares. Under SPDJI's free-float adjustment methodology, a company’s outstanding shares are adjusted if, and only
if, an entity in any of the four qualified categories listed above owns 5% or more of the company. The company’s shares will not be adjusted if the block ownership is less than 5%. A constituent’s inclusion factor is equal to its
estimated percentage of free-float shares outstanding. For example, a constituent security with a free-float of 67% will be included in the index at 67% of its market capitalization. However, a company’s outstanding shares are not adjusted by
institutional investors’ holdings, which include, but are not limited to, the following categories: custodian nominees, trustee companies, mutual funds (open-end and closed-end funds), and other investment companies.</font></div>

<div>The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the
weight of the securities of any single issuer to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the Underlying Index constrains at each quarterly review: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight
of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to a maximum of 22.50%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than
5% of the weight of the Underlying Index constitute more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there
is reasonable evidence of common control.</div> <div>Dow Jones U.S.

<div>The FTSE Nareit Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font>
The FTSE Nareit U.S. Real Estate Indexes (“FTSE Nareit Indexes”) are primarily rule-based, but are also monitored by the FTSE Nareit Index Advisory Committee. All tax-qualified REITs that are listed on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or
the Nasdaq are eligible for inclusion in the FTSE Nareit Indexes. Potential constituents for the FTSE Nareit All Mortgage Capped Index and the FTSE Nareit All Residential Capped Index are determined by sector classifications of constituents in the
FTSE Nareit Composite Index. The FTSE Nareit Indexes are reviewed for changes in free-float on a quarterly basis in March, June, September and December for companies which do not qualify for fast entry, but which meet the criteria for eligible
securities set out in the index rules. Meetings to review the constituents will be held on the Thursday following the first Friday of March, June, September and December. The review is based on data at the close of business on the last trading day
of February, May, August and November. The FTSE Nareit Index Advisory Committee meets quarterly, in March, June, September and December or more frequently, if required.</font></div>
<div>When calculating index component weights, component
companies’ shares are adjusted for available free-float. In general, shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or other control groups are excluded from a constituent company’s outstanding shares.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> FTSE
International Limited (“FTSE”) is responsible for the daily operation of the FTSE Nareit Indexes. FTSE will maintain records of the market capitalization of all constituents, and will make changes to the constituents and their weightings
in accordance with index rules. FTSE will also carry out the periodic company reviews of the FTSE Nareit Indexes and implement the resulting constituent changes as required by index rules.</font></div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> New issues of
companies that do not qualify for “Fast Entry” but meet the criteria for eligible securities and have been listed for over 20 business trading days will be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE Nareit Indexes. The data will be compiled as
of the close of business on the last business day in February, May, August and November. The changes will be effective after the close of business on the third Friday in March, June, September and December.</font></div>
<div>If a constituent is delisted, or ceases to have a firm
quotation, or is subject to a takeover offer which has been declared wholly unconditional, it will be removed from the indexes of which it is a constituent.</div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The FTSE
Nareit Indexes are calculated continuously during normal trading hours of the Nasdaq, NYSE Amex Equities and NYSE, and are closed on U.S. holidays.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates and Pricing.<font>
The prices used to calculate the FTSE Nareit Indexes are the Reuters daily closing prices or those figures accepted as such. FTSE Nareit reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day. For end-of-day alternative currency
calculations, FTSE Nareit uses the WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rates.</font></div>

Index</div> <div><font>Number of
Components: approximately 483</font></div> <div>Index Description. <font>The FTSE Developed ex US ex Korea Small Cap Focused Value Index measures the performance of international developed small-capitalization companies, excluding the U.S. and Korea, with prominent value factor
characteristics, as determined by FTSE International Limited. The Underlying Index is a subset of the FTSE Developed ex US ex Korea Small Cap Index (the “Parent Index”), which measures the performance of the small-capitalization segment
of the international developed equity market, excluding the U.S. and Korea, as defined by FTSE International Limited.</font></div>
<div>Eligibility. The eligible universe of securities for the
Underlying Index includes all issuers within the Parent Index, subject to the following rules and exceptions:</div>
<div>● If a company has issued multiple lines of equity
capital, only one eligible line is included. The eligible line is the line with the highest 60 days average daily dollar trading volume (“ADDTV”). A minimum of 30 days of daily observations are required to calculate ADDTV. If a line has
missing ADDTV, the line is excluded. If all lines have no ADDTV, the line with the highest free float market cap is selected.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Securities ranked within the least liquid 20% by count based on 60-day ADDTV are excluded.</div>
<div>● Securities ranked within the top 20% highest risk or

<div>● Securities ranked within the top 20% highest leverage
or with missing data are excluded. Leverage is defined as total debt to total assets sourced from a third party data provider.</div>
<div>● Also excluded are preferred and convertible preferred
stock, participating preferred stock, redeemable shares, warrants and rights, trust receipts, royalty trusts, limited liability issuers, OTC bulletin boards and pink sheet stocks, mutual funds, and limited partnerships.</div>
<div>A sentiment score is calculated using estimates for earnings
per share sourced from third party data providers. The sentiment score is calculated as follows:</div>
<div>(Number of upgrades for earnings per share for current and
next fiscal year - Number of downgrades for earnings per share for current and next fiscal year)/ Total number of estimates for earnings per share for current and next fiscal year.</div>
<div>Negative price momentum is determined based on monthly price
returns over the trailing 12 months, excluding the latest month. Securities with both a negative sentiment score and negative price momentum are excluded.</div>
<div>Eligible securities are ranked by a weighted composite score
of three value metrics (price-to-book (10%), price-to-earnings (30%) and price-to-cash flow from operations (60%)) (the “Composite Score”). The top ranked stocks are selected until the number of securities is 25% of the Parent Index by
count to form the Target Index (the “Target Index”), which is re-evaluated each month. Each security included in the Target Index is weighted in proportion to their float adjusted market capitalization with a country cap that is +/- 10%
relative to the Parent Index.</div> <div>Index Maintenance and Issue
Changes. <font>The Underlying Index will be reviewed monthly, with changes arising from review being announced after the close of business on the fifth business day preceding the implementation after the close of business
on the third Friday of the month. The Underlying Index is rebalanced to the Target Index if any of the following conditions are met:</font></div>
<div>● The Underlying Index’s Composite Score is less
than 90% of the Target Index’s Composite Score.</div>
<div>● The number of securities in the Underlying Index is
fewer than 20% of the Parent Index securities by count.</div>
<div>If no rebalance is triggered, the index weights and
constituents remain unchanged.</div> <div>A constituent will be
removed from the Underlying Index if it is also removed from the Parent Index. The deletion will be concurrent with the deletion from the Parent Index and its weight will be distributed pro-rata amongst the remaining constituents. Thus, the number
of securities in the Underlying Index over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity.</div>
<div>Additions to the Parent Index will be considered for inclusion
in the Underlying Index at the next review.</div> <div>FTSE Nareit

<div>Index Description.<font> The FTSE
Nareit All Mortgage Capped Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that measures the performance of the residential and commercial mortgage real estate, mortgage finance and savings associations sectors of the U.S. equity
market. The FTSE Nareit All Mortgage Capped Index generally measures the performance of the residential and commercial mortgage real estate sector and generally invests all of its assets in REITs. If the number of constituents in the FTSE Nareit All
Mortgage Capped Index would otherwise fall below 20, FTSE will consider companies from the mortgage finance and savings associations sectors for inclusion in the FTSE Nareit All Mortgage Capped Index and each company in the mortgage finance and
savings associations sector will be capped at 3%, and in aggregate not exceed 30%. FTSE caps the weight of the constituent securities in the Underlying Index.</font></div>

<div>ICE Biotechnology Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 277</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The ICE Biotechnology Index is a rules-based, modified float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of qualifying U.S.-listed biotechnology companies.</font></div>
<div>Eligibility.<font> Underlying Index
eligibility includes common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs, and shares of beneficial interest or limited partnership interests that are listed on one of the following U.S exchanges: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE American, Cboe BZX, NASDAQ
Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market. Companies must be classified within the Biotechnology Sub-Industry Group of the ICE Uniform Sector Classification schema and meet certain minimum market capitalization, liquidity, and other criteria to be
eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Weighting.<font> The Underlying
Index is float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted subject to certain exposure limits. First, all constituents are capped at 8% with any excess weight redistributed on a pro-rata basis to constituents below that cap, provided none can be
increased above 8%. Next, the weights of constituents outside the initial five largest are capped at 4% with any excess weight redistributed on a pro-rata basis to (i) any of the five largest constituents that are below 8% (provided they cannot be
increased above 8%), and (ii) any other constituents that are below 4% (provided none are increased above 4%). Finally, the cumulative weight of all ADRs is capped at 10% with the reductions applied proportionately across that group. Excess weight
is redistributed on a pro-rata basis to (i) any non-ADR constituents among the resulting five largest constituents that are below 8% (provided they cannot be increased above 8%) and (ii) any other non-ADR constituents that are below 4% (provided
they cannot be increased above 4%).</font></div> <div>Issue Changes.<font> The Underlying Index undergoes a full reconstitution of constituent holdings annually in December. At the annual reconstitution, qualifying constituents are re-selected based on the eligibility criteria, and
float-adjusted market capitalization weights are determined subject to the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for the input data used to determine security qualification is the close of the last trading day of October, and reference data
for the input data used to determine weights is the close of the last trading day of November. The announcement date is the close of the first Friday of December.</font></div>
<div>Quarterly Index Rebalancing.<font>
In addition to the annual reconstitution, the Underlying Index is rebalanced after the close of the third Friday of March, June, and September. At the quarterly rebalances, no constituents are added to or removed from the Underlying Index; however,
constituent weights are recalculated based on updated float-adjusted market capitalizations subject to the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for all input data used in the quarterly rebalances is the close of the last trading day of the
month preceding the month of effectiveness (February, May, August) and the announcement date is the close of the first Friday of the rebalance month.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> The
Underlying Index is adjusted for corporate actions that affect constituents and implements any intra-quarter float-adjusted shares outstanding updates greater than 10% in scheduled monthly share updates that take effect after the close of the last
trading day of each month. Securities are removed from the Underlying Index only when both the transaction and delisting is either confirmed or deemed imminent. If a security is suspended prior to its removal from the Underlying Index, then the
security is deleted at the close of the next trading day at either the last traded price (cash only terms) or the value of the deal terms (share or cash/share terms), if available. There are no intra-quarter replacements of constituents in the
Underlying Index. The Underlying Index implements a zero-price spin-off policy. A spin-co is added into the Underlying Index effective for the spin-off ex-date with a $0 price and no price adjustment is made on the parent company. After the close of
the first day of trading for the spin-co, it is deleted from the Underlying Index at its last traded price.</font></div>

Changes.<font> The Underlying Index undergoes a full reconstitution of constituent holdings annually in September. At the annual reconstitution, qualifying constituents are re-selected based on the eligibility criteria,
and float-adjusted market capitalization weights are determined subject to the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for the input data used to determine security qualification is the close of the last trading day of July, and reference data
for the input data used to determine weights is the close of the last trading day of August. The announcement date is the close of the first Friday of September.</font></div>
<div>Quarterly Index Rebalancing.<font>
In addition to the annual reconstitution, the Underlying Index is rebalanced after the close of the third Friday of March, June, and December. At the quarterly rebalances, no constituents are added to or removed from the Underlying Index; however,
constituent weights are recalculated based on updated float-adjusted market capitalizations subject to the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for all input data used in the quarterly rebalances is the close of the last trading day of the
month preceding the month of effectiveness (February, May, November) and the announcement date is the close of the first Friday of the rebalance month.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> The
Underlying Index is adjusted for corporate actions that affect constituents and implements any intra-quarter float-adjusted shares outstanding updates greater than 10% in scheduled monthly share updates that take effect after the close of the last
trading day of each month. Securities are removed from the Underlying Index only when both the transaction and delisting is either confirmed or deemed imminent. If a security is suspended prior to its removal from the Underlying Index, then the
security is deleted at the close of the next trading day at either the last traded price (cash only terms) or the value of the deal terms (share or cash/share terms), if available. There are no intra-quarter replacements of constituents in the
Underlying Index. The Underlying Index implements a zero-price spin-off policy. A spin-co is added into the Underlying Index effective for the spin-off ex-date with a $0 price and no price adjustment is made on the parent company. After the close of
the first day of trading for the spin-co, it is deleted from the Underlying Index at its last traded price.</font></div>
<div>JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 399</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return Index was jointly developed by Japan Exchange Group, Inc. and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (“TSE”) (collectively referred to as the “JPX Group”) and Nikkei Inc.
(the “Nikkei”). The JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return Index is constructed based on market capitalization adjusted by free-float weight. Free-float weight is the percentage of listed shares deemed to be available for trading in the market.
As a general matter, shares held by the top 10 major shareholders, treasury and other similar shares, shares held by board members and other representatives, and other shares deemed by the JPX Group and the Nikkei to be unavailable for trading in
the market are considered to be non-free float shares.</font></div>
<div>Eligibility.<font> Underlying Index
eligibility is limited to (i) common stocks traded primarily on the TSE, including the First Section, Second Section, Mothers and JASDAQ market (“JASDAQ”) market (in principle) and (ii) TSE First Section, TSE Second Section, Mothers or
JASDAQ-listed securities other than common stocks that are regarded by the JPX Group and the Nikkei as equivalent to common stocks in each case if their inclusion is deemed to be particularly necessary- as determined by the JPX Group and the
Nikkei.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance and Issue Changes. <font>The constituents are reviewed annually at the end of August. Selection as particularly necessary is based on: (i) trading value over the past three years, (ii) market value on the selection base date (the end of June),
(iii) scoring by stock by three-year average returns on equity, cumulative operating profit and market value on the selection base date using specified weightings and (iv) qualitative factors tied to corporate governance and disclosure. The JPX
Group and the Nikkei have indicated that securities will be dropped from the Underlying Index during the year if they are delisted or are the subject of a merger or bankruptcy and that new securities will not be added to replace dropped securities
until the annual review. As a result, at different points throughout the calendar year, the Underlying Index may have less than 400 components.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.
<font>Information regarding adjustments to the Underlying Index and other related data is available through Tokyo Market Information service provided by TSE.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 154</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet U.S. Infrastructure Index<sup>TM</sup> is designed to measure
the performance of equity securities of U.S. companies involved in U.S. focused infrastructure activities (as determined by the index provider of the Underlying Index).</font></div>
<div>Companies are eligible to be included in the Underlying Index
if they are classified to be under one of the 95 infrastructure-related industries as defined by FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (“RBICS”). Each company in the Underlying Index is classified as either Category 1 or
Category 2, where Category 1 companies are infrastructure enablers and Category 2 are infrastructure asset owners and operators.</div>
<div>Infrastructure enablers are potential beneficiaries of
infrastructure investment in the U.S. Category 1 companies in the Underlying Index include companies in construction and engineering services, machineries and materials. Infrastructure asset owners and operators are companies associated with
traditional equity infrastructure investing, which generally exhibit characteristics such as having stable cash flows, a high barrier to entry, and being an inflation hedge. Category 2 companies in the Underlying Index include companies in energy
transportation and storage, railroad transportation, and utilities.</div>
<div>At the time of inclusion, eligible companies must derive 50%
or more of their annual revenues from the U.S. The Underlying Index applies an equal weighting to Category 1 and Category 2, and within each category, an equal weighting is also applied to all individual securities.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index will be reviewed and reconstituted
annually in March each year. Constituent weights of the Underlying Index are rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September and December.</div>

<div>All eligible securities are sorted by decreasing total market
capitalization to determine index eligibility.</div> <div>The
Russell 1000 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the investable U.S. equity market. It is a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted index consisting approximately
1000 of the largest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index.</div>
<div>For the Russell 3000<sup>®</sup> Index and the Russell 1000<sup>®</sup> Index, the weights of component issuers are adjusted based on
available float-weighted capitalization according to the market value of their available outstanding shares. The impact of a component security’s price change is proportional to the issuer’s total market value, which is the share price
times the number of shares available. Each Russell Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events.</div>
<div>Frank Russell Company uses a probability measure to assign
stocks to the growth and value style indexes. The probability measure is used to indicate the degree of certainty that a stock is value or growth, based on three fundamental indicators: relative price-to-book (“PB”) ratio, Institutional
Brokers’ Estimate System forecast medium-term growth (2 years) and sales per share historical growth (5 years). This method allows stocks to be represented as having both growth and value characteristics, while preserving the additive nature
of the indexes. As a result, a stock may be a component of a Russell growth style index and also a component of the corresponding value style index, although the stock would likely have a different weight in each index.</div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> Securities that
leave the Russell Indexes between reconstitution dates are not replaced. Thus, the number of securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity. When a stock is acquired, delisted or moves to the pink sheets
or OTC bulletin boards, the stock is deleted from the relevant indexes.</font></div>
<div>When acquisitions or mergers take place, the stock’s
capitalization moves to the acquiring stock, hence, mergers have no effect on index total capitalization if the acquiring stock is part of the index. The only additions between reconstitution dates are as a result of spin-offs and IPOs.</div>
<div>Issue Changes for the Focused Value Select Index.<font> The Focused Value Select Index will be reviewed monthly, with changes being implemented after the close of the 6<sup>th</sup> business day. Changes arising
from review are announced after the close of the 4<sup>th</sup> business day. The Underlying Index is rebalanced to the Target Index if any of the following conditions are

<div>Russell US Large Cap Factors Growth Style Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 133</font></div> <div>Index Description. <font>The Russell US Large Cap Factors Growth Style Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Growth Index (the “Parent Index”), which measures the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization growth sector of the
U.S. equity market, as defined by Russell. The Parent Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index, which measures the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the U.S. equity market. The Underlying Index is reviewed monthly using
an optimization process designed to maximize, in aggregate, the Underlying Index’s exposure to the weighted combination of five target investment style factors (momentum, value, quality, size, and low volatility) while maintaining total risk
similar to that of the Parent Index. The value score is calculated from the following value factor metrics: 12-month trailing book-to-price, dividend yield, earnings yield and cash flow yield (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, cash flow divided by the full market capitalization). The momentum score is calculated from three momentum factor metrics: price momentum, earnings
momentum and earnings announcement drift (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the difference between a stock’s performance on and immediately following an earnings
announcement date). The quality score is calculated from four quality factor metrics: gross profitability, dilution, accruals and changes in net operating assets. The low volatility score is calculated based on a 12-month trailing realized
volatility, and the size score seeks to measure the market capitalization of each company as compared to other companies of the Parent Index.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> The
methodology uses a composite score (by using a weighting of the five factor scores determined by the Index Provider) as an input to the optimizer. At each monthly review, the optimizer aims to maximize the overall exposure to the five style factors
via the composite score and maintain a level of forecast risk similar that of the Parent Index, while also limiting exposures to sectors, countries and component weights relative to the parent index. The optimizer selects securities from the Parent
Index and assigns weights such that the optimization objective and constraints are best satisfied. Changes arising from each monthly review are announced after the close of fourth business day of each month and implemented after the close of the
sixth business day of each month.</font></div> <div>Russell US Large

<div>The S&amp;P Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for Domestic Indexes. <font>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC’s (“SPDJI”) various Index Committees are responsible for the overall management of SPDJI's indices (“S&amp;P DJI Indices”). Issuers (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the “components”) selected for the S&amp;P U.S. indexes represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting
universe of publicly traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS<sup>®</sup>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited
partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of each
constituent must trade on either the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most
liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the
S&amp;P Indexes: (i) ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the
financial and operating condition of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are capitalization-weighted,
based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted
market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s minimum market capitalization at the time
it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s components are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The
market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including private, corporate, and government holdings.</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for International Indexes. <font>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is balanced across country and sector
weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering approximately 95% of each country’s total market capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs
and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a candidate pool for index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The
specific securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked according to GICS. Then, the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market
capitalization methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s liquidity over a period of at least twelve months before consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added
immediately (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of the
sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s components are
adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including
private, corporate, and government holdings.</font></div> <div>With
respect to the non-U.S. components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which
represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 (TSE) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly-listed issuers in the Japanese equities market;
(iii) S&amp;P/ASX All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four major equities
markets in Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets; and (vi) the
S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering approximately 70% of the region’s market capitalization.</div> </div>

Changes. <font>General oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments,
including additions and deletions to these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock
exchanges. Public announcements of index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements
may be made earlier.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance. <font>Maintaining the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring
and spin-offs. An issuer will be removed from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event
occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section
criteria.</font></div> <div>When calculating index weights,
individual components shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded regardless of whether they are index
components. In countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect either the foreign investment limit or the percentage float, whichever is the
more restrictive.</div> <div>Each issuer’s financial
statements will be used to update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (“IWF”) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical
float factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (<font>i.e.</font>, privatization, merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than
5%, a float adjustment will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.</div>
<div>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by
corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday
near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release posted on <font>www.us.spindices.com.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The
S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates. <font>SPDJI uses the
World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time for the following funds: iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp; P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Europe
ETF, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares North American Natural Resources ETF and iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF. Prior to January 31, 2013, SPDJI used the currency exchange
(FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m. Eastern time. In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day), the previous business day’s rates are normally
used. SPDJI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. SPDJI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if SPDJI determines that
the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency on a particular day.</font></div>

<div>Notations Regarding the iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF's,
iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF's, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF's, iShares Factors US Growth Style ETF's, iShares Factors US Value Style ETF's, iShares Focused Value Factor ETF's, iShares International Developed Small Cap
Value Factor ETF's, iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF's and iShares US Small Cap Value Factor ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>The following notations are not considered to be part of each
Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>investment in issuers
domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be
considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to a Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating
group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to a Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks
or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset
coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of
all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus
are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance interpretations, when a Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund, instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark
liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be
interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid
assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be
borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment
Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the
Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities
may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be
interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in
the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>

<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in
the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently limits each Fund's holdings in illiquid investments to
15% of a Fund's net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments, pursuant to the Liquidity Program.</div>
<div>If any percentage restriction described above is complied with
at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain percentage limitations will be observed continuously in
accordance with applicable law.</div> <div>All Funds</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in
accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, for all Funds other than the iShares U.S. Infrastructure
ETF, in component securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary receipts representing component securities in the Underlying Index, and for the iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF, in component securities of its Underlying Index. Each Fund also
has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in
a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance
on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of
Section 12(d)(1).</div> <div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments
resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax
consequences.</div> <div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are</div> </div>

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to
review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the
Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its
finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to
exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief</div> </div>

his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s
internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees
have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a
guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</div>
<div>Committees of the Board of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board (i) in

thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the
independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; and (vi) to assume

<div>The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
Cecilia H. Herbert (Chair), Madhav V. Rajan and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee nominates individuals for Independent Trustee membership on the Board and recommends appointments to the
Advisory Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee functions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) reviewing the qualifications of any person properly identified or nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee; (ii) recommending
to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy for a position of
Independent Trustee(s) on the Board; (iii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the size and composition of the Board and Board committees and whether they comply with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) recommending a
current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of compensation for the Independent Trustees for
their services as Trustees, members or chairpersons of committees of the Board, Board Chair and any other positions as the Nominating and Governance Committee considers appropriate. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not consider Board
nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.</div>
<div>Each Independent Trustee serves on the 15(c) Committee. The
Chair of the 15(c) Committee is Drew E. Lawton. The principal responsibilities of the 15(c) Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for the annual review and renewal of the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory
agreements. These responsibilities include: (i) meeting with BlackRock, Inc. in advance of the Board meeting at which the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory agreements are to be considered to discuss generally the process for providing requested
information to the Board and the format in which information will be provided; and (ii) considering and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to evaluate the investment
advisory and sub-advisory agreements of the Trust. The 15(c) Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.</div>

and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to oversee the Trust's securities lending activities and make required findings and approvals; and (iii) providing a
recommendation to the Board regarding the annual approval of the Trust's Securities Lending Guidelines and the required findings with respect to, and annual approval of, the Trust's agreement with the securities lending agent. The Securities Lending

<div>Potential Conflicts of Interest. <font> Certain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and their respective directors, officers and employees,
with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged
worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and
which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in
securities or other instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or
advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities,
currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock
is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund
invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that
may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Funds.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>some cases, this system
may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values,
prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions
regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with,
similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the
Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including
purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div>
<div>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding
a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other
accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to
asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with
respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock
or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or
advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or
more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock
designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing
services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other
markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may
have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In
addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other</div> </div> <div type="Block">

for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or
strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in
the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of
such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for
clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority interest will create, write or issue options which
may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to
the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices
Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual
property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock
will not receive any such payments on those derivative products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could
contribute to the viability or success of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could
also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may cause business units or
entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</div>
<div>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act
as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment
fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and
other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a
broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Subject to
applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial
capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in
other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties based
on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the
credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate <font>pro rata </font>allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate <font>pro rata </font>allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font> indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough
inventory, either on its own or when aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether
BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different
securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund
may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not
required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Subject to
applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in BlackRock's
view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by law,
research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or
other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the
research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client
accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate
benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for
those products and services itself.</div> <div>BlackRock does not
currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular
broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to
pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such
arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in
the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and request that the
broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional
soft dollars may exist.</div> <div>BlackRock may utilize certain
electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain
types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions
and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain
circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of,
Members Exchange (“MEMX”), a newly created U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of
such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may in the future be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock,
provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section
of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible that, from time to

liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem
in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock itself or a
BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing
requirements for the Fund.</div> <div>It is possible that a Fund
may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock
provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any
unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may engage in transactions with
companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers
may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability
relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their
shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to
BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a
Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a
potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients
with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such
valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants,
there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by
BlackRock’s Valuation Committee (the “Valuation Committee”) in accordance with policies and procedures approved by a Fund’s Board (the “Valuation Procedures”). When determining a “fair value price,”
the Valuation Committee seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund
might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the
time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value
of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a
Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued by the Valuation Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may
affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from,
or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common
officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund
to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory
requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those
considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock
is performing advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling
securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a
creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with
BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an advisory or risk
management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their
proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer
disadvantages or business restrictions.</div> <div>If certain
aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or
exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict,
forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any</div> </div> <div type="Block">

threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of
Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and
BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to
benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license
for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep
uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall
relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated with respect to
a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which
could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain
trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and
funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to
BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in
connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall
relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in a Fund.</div> </div>

addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation

based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the team relative to the
portfolios’ investment objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock.
Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key
employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term shareholders and motivate performance.</div>

<div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The
Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, including securities
that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism or other
illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information
will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from
persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow the Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the
Funds' policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</div>

administrative, legal, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, State Street makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to

provides other services. State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to deliver securities held by State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street is authorized to appoint certain
foreign custodians or foreign custody managers for Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant to the Service Module for Transfer Agency Services with the Trust, State Street acts as a transfer agent for each Fund’s authorized and issued shares

in the applicable Prospectus and below in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may
be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>

resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount</div> </div>

iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for
Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or
for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make
payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to
Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA
Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment
in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your
salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types
of the contractual payments described above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and
Associates, LLC, Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., L.P., Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., FDx Advisors, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC,

<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other
intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may
include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in
general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives
his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds
or other exchange-traded products.</font></div> <div>The Funds may
participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund
to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the
securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund
assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV
for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE (currently 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as follows:</font></div>
<div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity
securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities exchange or through a market system
that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an Exchange closing price is not available,
the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more
than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the
prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days or
less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of
each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Options,
Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of
trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price,
if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no
longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon
quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a
Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively.
Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div>
<div>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular
portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing
service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s
ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a
Fund’s books at their fair value.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Fund’s Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at
fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or the Valuation Committee (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
prevailing market rates.</div> <div>Use of fair value prices and
certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s performance and
the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in
accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete
lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a
recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a
significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred after the close of trading
for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of,
a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of
any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>For certain
foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is
designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>BFA, with input from portfolio management, will submit its
recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent
periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BFA, to regularly evaluate the values assigned to the securities and other assets and
liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
Valuation Committee will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or liability is being valued,
and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available
factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the investment may be initially priced based on the
original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable
instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an investment.</div>
<div>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not,
in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at
NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements.</div> <div>Generally, ASC 820 and other
accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities,
to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their
liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value. The SEC recently adopted new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which will establish an updated regulatory framework for registered investment company
valuation practices and may impact a Fund’s valuation policies. A Fund will not be required to comply with the new rule until September 8, 2022.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>BFA may select a broker
based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the
commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their
ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>The Funds
anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of depositary
receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., will
be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions,</div> </div>

affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of
another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client
for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal,
trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is</div>

different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice could
have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients
during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified as
being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the
order.</div> <div>The table below sets forth the brokerage
commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets over those periods or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div> <div>

<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be
combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or
about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest
for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the
1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds
will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as
within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses.</div>

<div>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</div>
<div>Shares.<font>  The Trust
currently consists of more than 305 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Each share
issued by a fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate
equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through
subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Beneficial
ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred
to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may
decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust
shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit
size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div> <div>Any
Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in
such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><sup>1</sup></div>
<div>The approximate value per creation unit
for the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is as of July 19, 2021.</div>
<div>In its discretion, the Trust reserves the right to increase or
decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a corresponding change in the number of
shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day the Fund is open for business, including any day when it satisfies redemption requests as required by Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for business any day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is
open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div> <div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally consists of the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component
constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents
the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the
next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing the Creation
Unit.</div> <div>The identity and number of shares of the Deposit
Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of
the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>159</div> </div> </div> <div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The Fund
Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit through “systematic rounding.” The rounding methodology “rounds up” position sizes
of securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</div>
<div>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards
a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments are not
eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able to be traded due to a trading
restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; (v) in connection
with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they
will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide
through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and
redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows
such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units (an “Authorized Participant”). Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and
on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once
the NAV of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into
an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should
be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized
Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC
Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized
Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed
as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To
initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to
receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>custodian will then
provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other
than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those
placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business
Day.</div> <div>The Authorized Participant must also make available
on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order,
together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the
Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a
weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or
its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the
facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> <div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon
the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized
Participant that placed the order.</div> <div>Each Fund reserves
the absolute right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently
outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences to the
Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii)
circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Issuance of a
Creation Unit.<font>   Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been
completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its
agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a
shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, in order to accommodate
non-U.S. market holiday schedules to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized
Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. Information
concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time
and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other
charges.</div> <div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may
create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption
transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined
by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized
Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or
partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades
resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs
associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Redemption of iShares Russell 2000 ETF During Certain Market
Conditions.<font>  By submitting a redemption request, an Authorized Participant is deemed to represent to the Trust, consistent with the Authorized Participant Agreement, that (1) it has the requisite number of
shares to deliver to the Trust to satisfy the redemption request, (2) such shares have not been loaned or pledged to any other party and are free and clear of any liens and encumbrances, and (3) it will not lend, hypothecate or otherwise encumber
the shares after the submission of the redemption request. These deemed representations are subject to verification under certain circumstances with respect to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Specifically, if an Authorized Participant submits a
redemption request with respect to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF on a Business Day on which the Trust determines, based on information available to the Trust on such Business Day, that (i) the short interest of the Fund in the marketplace is greater
than or equal to 150% and (ii) the orders in the aggregate from all Authorized Participants redeeming Fund shares on such Business Day represent 25% or more of the shares outstanding of the Fund, such Authorized Participant will be required to
verify to the Trust (in a form specified by the Trust) the accuracy of its deemed representations. If, after receiving notice of the verification requirement, the Authorized Participant does not verify the accuracy of its deemed representations in
accordance with this requirement, its redemption request will be considered not to have been timely received in proper form.</font></div>
<div>Redemption of Creation Units.
<font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on
a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the
secondary market.</font></div> <div>Each Fund generally redeems
Creation Units for Fund Securities (as defined below). Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming
Creation Units of the Funds.</div> <div>The designated portfolio of
securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day
(“Fund Securities” or “Redemption Basket”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below) (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of
Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations
of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund,
the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption
request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would
be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized Participant
due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or otherwise
delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event that the Fund
Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>difference is required to
be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may,
in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the
Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be “rounded up,”
while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that
account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the
same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash
Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div> <div>Costs
Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption
transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day.
If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses
related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a
Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be
charged a fee for such services.</font></div> <div>The following

Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable
request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to
be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current
Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The
Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their

Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should
allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within
two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle deliveries of redemption proceeds on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or
appropriate under the circumstances and compliance with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to account for
different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (<font>i.e., </font>the last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the
security sold) and in certain other circumstances consistent with applicable law.</div>

Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible
to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such
case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and
additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal
and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or
cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions
of Creation Units, in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days
thereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents
timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15
days.</div> <div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized
Participant’s agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or
prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>of submission of such
redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized
Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date of
submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the
Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of
purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is
suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other
circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div> <div>Custom Baskets.<font>  Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept “custom baskets.” A custom basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection
of a Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or (iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant.
Each Fund has adopted policies and procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and
acceptance of custom baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to
review each custom basket for compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of
custom baskets that may be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has
established a governance process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</font></div>
<div>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of the Creation Units
purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation
Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a
Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div> </div>

Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must
annually distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of
each Fund’s annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not
limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of
their income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be
represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the
value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government
securities or the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or
the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of
its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely
cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal
Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may
result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will be
subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines
that doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings
and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its
assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such
assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Excise Tax.<font>  A Fund will
be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12
months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by</font></div> </div>

minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute
dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font></div>
<div>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership
change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>

distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar
year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount
equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event,
the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares
of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their
credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over</div> </div>

Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or
claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions of net
realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of
capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving
cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e.</font>, the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares. <font> Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>increased to reflect the
disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or
deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</div>
<div>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of
a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the disregarded
portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This provision
prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a
Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been
equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders.
The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent
permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and
losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay
dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a
RIC.</font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“Section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All Section 1256 contracts
held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value
at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and
were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>transaction. Periodic net
payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one
year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes
as ordinary income or loss.</div> <div>Qualified Dividend Income. <font> Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income,
which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in
general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, non-U.S.
corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S.
(where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,
China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,
Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</font></div>
<div>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified
dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with
respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding
requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to
a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that
dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer
who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the extent the RIC’s income is derived from
ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a Fund of its net short-term capital
gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</div> <div>Corporate
Dividends Received Deduction.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for
corporations. A 46-day minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference
dividends) during which risk of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness,
including a short sale, is attributable to the investment.</font></div>
<div>Excess Inclusion Income.
<font> Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) from being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt
shareholder could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types
of income received by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as “excess inclusion income.” To Fund
shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain
charitable entities; (ii) not be offset</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain “disqualified organizations,” as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is
imposed on the trust.</div> <div>A Fund tries to avoid investing in
REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT may change its investment
program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive investment opportunities.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments.
<font> Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated
in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988
gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and
certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless a
Fund was to elect otherwise.</font></div> <div>Each Fund may be
subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to “pass through” to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the security on the
dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed distribution will
(i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but
only for investors who itemize their deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes.
Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not “passed through” for tax purposes will not be available to shareholders
for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the Fund elects to “pass through” its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.
tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate
shares of non-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income.
Certain limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by
a Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under
certain circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. <font> If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed
as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC
as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information
from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to
the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that
would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of
previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could
potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from
dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible,
and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div>
<div>Reporting. <font> If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations
of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains”
(generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible
dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a
non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div>Special rules may apply to a
foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code
and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the foreign
shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income</div>

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on

account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the
IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of
U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required
information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder
information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

Communications to the Board. <font> The Board has established a process for shareholders to communicate with the Board. Shareholders may contact the Board by mail. Correspondence should be addressed to iShares Board
of Trustees, c/o BlackRock Fund Advisors, iShares Fund Administration, 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Shareholder communications to the Board should include the following information: (i) the name and address of the shareholder; (ii)
the number of shares owned by the shareholder; (iii) the Fund(s) of which the shareholder owns shares; and (iv) if these shares are owned indirectly through a broker, financial intermediary or other record owner, the name of the broker, financial
intermediary or other record owner. All correspondence received as set forth above shall be reviewed by the Secretary of the Trust and reported to the Board.</font></div>
<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to
investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</div>
<div>iShares Biotechnology ETF<br/> iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF<br/>
iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF<br/> iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF<br/> iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF<br/> iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF<br/> iShares Russell 2000 ETF<br/> iShares Russell 3000 ETF<br/> iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF<br/>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people
experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a
full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the
world.</div> <div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”)
activities are focused on maximizing long-term value for our clients. BIS does this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached
to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests. Effective voting rights are central to the
rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be
able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital structure. In
order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long -term economic interests of our clients, and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long -term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a <font>team profile on our website</font>.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long -term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that investee companies are facing and their governance structures. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach
to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s engagements emphasize direct dialogue with
corporate leadership on the governance issues identified in these principles that have a material impact on financial performance. These engagements enable us to cast informed votes aligned with clients’ long-term economic interests. We
generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue
and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them
constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies, or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to
companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

relation to board structure) and why this approach is in the best interest of shareholders. We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the
company, or the performance of individual board members. We believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order for
shareholders to assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>
<table>

<td>current or former employment

<tr>

<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>interlocking directorships
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>having
 any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non -executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with
a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing
risk.</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Capital
structure, mergers, asset sales and other special transactions</div>
<div>The capital structure of a company is critical to its owners,
the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders against the dilution of
their interests.</div> <div>Effective voting rights are central to
the rights of ownership and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting
power should match economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned
that the creation of a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote
principle is designed to mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class
structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give
unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long -term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long -term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long -term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and
social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively
gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to issue reports aligned with the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of
disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate
change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against
these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification processes in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>1)
 </td>
<td>publish a disclosure in line
with industry-specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2)
 </td>
<td>disclose
climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to
less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>See our
<font>commentary</font><font> </font>on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors.</div>
<div>In deciding our course of action, we will assess the
company’s disclosures and the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company is in the
process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply,</div> </div>

<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long - term financial
sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate -related risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>We expect companies to help their investors understand how the
company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with
TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and
mitigating that risk.</div> <div>Where a company receives a
shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as
revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress
on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high standard in our investment
stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who do not have other responsibilities other than their roles
in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with
practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div>
<div>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees,
the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global
Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of
BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global
Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Committee also reviews and
approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long - term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div>
<div>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in
the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item. Portfolio managers may from time to time reach differing views on how best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment.
Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from one another. However, because BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are
frequently cast in a uniform manner.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

including but not limited to our need for additional information to make a voting decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic value of the company. Within the normal course
of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management or business partnership roles, in discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general
corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met. </td></tr>

<td>Determined
 to engage, in certain instances, an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such
circumstances, the independent fiduciary provides BlackRock’s proxy voting agent with instructions, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies, and BlackRock’s proxy voting agent votes the proxy in accordance with
the independent fiduciary’s determination. BlackRock uses an independent fiduciary to vote proxies of (i) any company that is affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., (ii) any public company that includes BlackRock employees on its board of directors,
(iii) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., (iv) any public company of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive, and (v) companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent fiduciary. In
selecting an independent fiduciary, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and vote in the best economic interest of our clients, reputation for reliability and integrity,
and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at an independent fiduciary. The
Global Committee appoints and reviews the performance of the independent fiduciar(ies), generally on an annual basis. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending
agent on behalf of Funds. With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The decision whether to recall securities on loan to vote is based
on a formal analysis of the revenue producing value to clients of loans, against the assessed economic value of casting votes. Generally, we expect that the likely economic value to clients of casting votes would be less than the securities lending
income, either because, in our assessment, the resolutions being voted on will not have significant economic consequences or because the outcome would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to vote. BlackRock also may, in
our discretion, determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div>
<div>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining
whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may modify it as necessary.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,
“BlackRock”) seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and enhance the economic value of the securities held in client accounts. The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the
“Guidelines”) are intended to summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s general philosophy and approach to corporate governance issues that most commonly arise in proxy voting for U.S. securities. These Guidelines are not
intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how BlackRock will vote in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide
insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots , as well as our expectations of boards of directors. They are applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the
company and the individual ballot item.</div> <div>VOTING
GUIDELINES</div> <div>These guidelines are divided into eight key
themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders:</div> <div>

<div>In general, BlackRock supports the election of directors as

committees in certain situations, as indicated below .</div>
<div>Independence</div>
<div>We expect a majority of the directors on the board to be
independent. In addition, all members of key committees, including audit, compensation, and nominating / governance committees, should be independent. Our view of independence may vary slightly from listing standards.</div>
<div>In particular, common impediments to independence in the U.S.
may include:</div> <div>

<div>Board composition and effectiveness</div>
<div>We encourage boards to periodically renew their membership to
ensure relevant skills and experience within the boardroom. To this end, regular performance reviews and skills assessments should be conducted by the nominating / governance committee.</div>
<div>Furthermore, we expect boards to be comprised of a diverse
selection of individuals who bring their personal and professional experiences to bear in order to create a constructive debate of competing views and opinions in the boardroom. We recognize that diversity has multiple dimensions. In identifying
potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the full breadth of diversity including personal factors, such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of
expertise, and geographic location. In addition to other elements of diversity, we encourage companies to have at least two women directors on their board. Our publicly available <font>commentary</font><sup> </sup>explains our approach to engaging on board diversity.</div>
<div>We encourage boards to disclose their views on:</div>
<div>
<table>

 </td>
<td>The mix
of competencies, experience, and other qualities required to effectively oversee and guide management in light of the stated long-term strategy of the company </td></tr>

<div>While we support regular board refreshment, we are not opposed
in principle to long-tenured directors, nor do we believe that long board tenure is necessarily an impediment to director independence. A variety of director tenures within the boardroom can be beneficial to ensure board quality and continuity of
experience.</div> <div>Our primary concern is that board members
are able to contribute effectively as corporate strategy evolves and business conditions change, and that all directors, regardless of tenure, demonstrate appropriate responsiveness to shareholders. We acknowledge that no single person can be
expected to bring all relevant skill sets to a board; at the same time, we generally do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to have any particular director on the board solely by virtue of a singular background or specific area of
expertise.</div> <div>Where boards find that age limits or term
limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits.</div>
<div>To the extent that we believe that a company has not
adequately accounted for diversity in its board composition within a reasonable timeframe, we may vote against the nominating / governance committee for an apparent lack of commitment to board effectiveness.</div> </div>

size</div> <div>We typically defer to the board in setting the
appropriate size and believe directors are generally in the best position to assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for effective shareholder representation or too large to
function efficiently.</div> <div>CEO and management succession
planning</div> <div>There should be a robust CEO and senior
management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. We expect succession planning to cover both long-term planning consistent with the strategic direction of the company and identified leadership
needs over time, as well as short-term planning in the event of an unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain its executive succession planning process, including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this
task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information commonly associated with this exercise.</div>
<div>Classified board of directors / staggered terms</div>
<div>We believe that directors should be re-elected annually and
that classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we may make
exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure, such as when a company needs consistency and stability during a time of transition, e.g. newly public companies or companies undergoing a
strategic restructuring. A classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating companies in certain circumstances. We would, however, expect boards with a classified structure to periodically review the rationale for such structure and
consider when annual elections might be appropriate.</div>
<div>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns of
a specific director, we may choose to vote against or withhold votes from the available slate of directors by default (see “Shareholder rights” for additional detail).</div>
<div>Contested director elections</div>
<div>The details of contested elections, or proxy contests, are
assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, which may include: the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the
dissident’s and management’s plans; the likelihood that the dissident’s solutions will produce the desired change; and whether the dissident represents the best option for enhancing long -term shareholder value.</div>
<div>Cumulative voting</div>
<div>We believe that a majority vote standard is in the best long
-term interest of shareholders. It ensures director accountability via the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may
disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or director candidates.</div>
<div>Director compensation and equity programs</div>
<div>We believe that compensation for directors should be
structured to attract and retain the best possible directors, while also aligning their interests with those of shareholders. We believe director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value creation and include some
form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal. In addition, we expect directors to build meaningful share ownership over time.</div>
<div>Majority vote requirements</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should generally be elected
by a majority of the shares voted and will normally support proposals seeking to introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by
shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. Some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where we believe that
the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

oversight</div> <div>Companies should have an established process
for identifying, monitoring, and managing key risks. Independent directors should have ready access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure they can properly oversee risk management. We encourage companies to
provide transparency around risk measurement, mitigation, and reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to changes in corporate strategy and / or shifts in the business
and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long -term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust
disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>Separation of chairman and CEO</div>
<div>We believe that independent leadership is important in the
boardroom. In the U.S. there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership: 1) an independent chairman; or 2) a lead independent director when the roles of chairman and CEO are combined.</div>
<div>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer
to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</div>
<div>In the event that the board chooses a combined chair / CEO
model, we generally support the designation of a lead independent director if they have the power to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent
directors. Furthermore, while we anticipate that most directors will be elected annually, we believe an element of continuity is important for this role for an extended period of time to provide appropriate leadership balance to the chair /
CEO.</div> <div>The following table illustrates examples of
responsibilities under each board leadership model:</div> <div>

<div>AUDITORS AND AUDIT-RELATED ISSUES</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial
statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board responsible for overseeing the
management of the audit function at a company, and may withhold votes from the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We look to</div> </div>

for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take particular note of cases involving
significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we expect timely disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a significant financial restatement, or the audit firm
has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders, we may also vote against ratification.</div>
<div>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to
promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</div>
<div>CAPITAL STRUCTURE PROPOSALS</div>
<div>Equal voting rights</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders should be entitled to
voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. We believe that companies that look to add or already have dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.
Companies should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure
or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Equal voting rights</div>

<div>Blank check preferred stock</div>
<div>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a
class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights (“blank check” preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from shareholders to the board and as a possible
entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to
management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</div>
<div>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the
company:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Appears to have a legitimate
financing motive for requesting blank check authority </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>

<div>Increase in authorized common shares</div>
<div>BlackRock considers industry-specific norms in our analysis of
these proposals, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares. Generally, we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firm’s
business. The most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is not in the economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</div>
<div>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred
stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

splits</div> <div>We generally support stock splits that are not
likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where the reverse split will not have a
negative impact on share value (e.g<font>.</font> one class is reduced while others remain at pre- split levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the
company’s authorized stock, we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</div>
<div>MERGERS, ASSET SALES, AND OTHER SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS</div>
<div>BlackRock’s primary concern is the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders. While merger, asset sales, and other special transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such as:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger announcement. In most cases, business combinations should
provide a premium. We may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments. For companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There should be clear
strategic, operational, and / or financial rationale for the combination </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Unanimous
board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider whether
executive and / or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>We
 prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Poison pill plans</div>
<div>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by
management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although we oppose most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable “qualifying offer clause.” Such clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill
and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed.</div>
<div>These clauses also tend to specify that an all cash bid for
all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote, or the board to seek the written consent of shareholders where
shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual
shareholders.</div> <div>We generally vote in favor of shareholder
proposals to rescind poison pills.</div> <div>Reimbursement of
expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</div> <div>We
generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign. We believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize
disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</div>
<div>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</div>
<div>We note that there are both management and shareholder
proposals related to executive compensation. We generally vote on these proposals as described below, except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is
sufficient to address the issue. We may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the company’s history suggests that the issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Advisory
resolutions on executive compensation (“Say on Pay”)</div>
<div>In cases where there is a Say on Pay vote, BlackRock will
respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to shareholders. In a commentary on our website, entitled “<font>BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation</font>,” we explain our beliefs and expectations related to executive compensation practices, our Say on Pay analysis framework,
and our typical approach to engagement and voting on Say on Pay.</div>
<div>Advisory votes on the frequency of Say on Pay resolutions</div>
<div>BlackRock will generally support triennial pay frequency
votes, but we defer to the board to determine the appropriate timeframe upon which pay should be reviewed. In evaluating pay, we believe that the compensation committee is responsible for constructing a plan that appropriately incentivizes
executives for long-term value creation, utilizing relevant metrics and structure to ensure overall pay and performance alignment. In a similar vein, we defer to the board to establish the most appropriate timeframe for review of pay structure,
absent a change in strategy that would suggest otherwise.</div>
<div>However, we may support an annual pay frequency vote in some
situations, for example, where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance. In these circumstances, we will also consider voting against the compensation committee members.</div>
<div>Claw back proposals</div>
<div>We generally favor recoupment from any senior executive whose
compensation was based on faulty financial reporting or deceptive business practices. In addition to fraudulent acts, we also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior caused direct financial harm to shareholders, reputational risk
to the company , or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for
directly by the company. We typically support shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns.</div>
<div>Employee stock purchase plans</div>
<div>We believe these plans can provide performance incentives and
help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common form of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically
support qualified ESPP proposals.</div> <div>Equity compensation
plans</div> <div>BlackRock supports equity plans that align the
economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of shareholders. We believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder
interests (e.g. the use of stock as collateral for a loan; the use of stock in a margin account; the use of stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative transactions). We may support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such
policies.</div> <div>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is
based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain “evergreen” provisions, which allow for
the unlimited increase of shares reserved without requiring further shareholder approval after a reasonable time period. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may also oppose plans that provide for
the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee before
acceleration or special payments are triggered.</div> <div>Golden
parachutes</div> <div>We generally view golden parachutes as
encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to shareholders. However, a large potential pay-out under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a management team to support a sub-optimal
sale price for a company. When determining whether to support or oppose an</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>advisory vote on a golden
parachute plan, we normally support the plan unless it appears to result in payments that are excessive or detrimental to shareholders. In evaluating golden parachute plans, BlackRock may consider several factors, including:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether we believe that the
triggering event is in the best interest of shareholders </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether management attempted
to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether excessively large
excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light of performance and peers </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
 the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to effectively manage the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan until
after it has been triggered; as a result, BlackRock may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved by shareholders when it was implemented.</div>
<div>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that
implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval. We generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed 2.99 times an executive’s current salary and bonus, including equity compensation.</div>
<div>Option exchanges</div>
<div>We believe that there may be legitimate instances where
underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case -by-case basis. BlackRock may support a request to reprice or exchange
underwater options under the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual company performance </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Directors
and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully contemplated </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is clear evidence that absent repricing, the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock may also support a request to exchange underwater
options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in the best interest of shareholders.</div>
<div>Pay-for-Performance plans</div>
<div>In order for executive compensation exceeding $1 million USD
to qualify for federal tax deductions, related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) requires companies to link compensation for the company’s top five executives to
disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval. The law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside directors administer these plans. Because the primary objective of these proposals is to
preserve the deductibility of such compensation, we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income.</div>
<div>Supplemental executive retirement plans</div>
<div>BlackRock may support shareholder proposals requesting to put
extraordinary benefits contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under
employee-wide plans.</div> <div>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
ISSUES</div> <div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and
enhance their economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>companies will deal
effectively with the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses. Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;
S risks and opportunities.</div> <div>BlackRock expects companies
to issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as
complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the
business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk
assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Publish
disclosures in line with industry specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Disclose
 climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to
less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>See our
<font>commentary</font> on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will
assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company is in the
process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social, ethical, or
political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect the ir long-term economic interests as shareholders. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long- term financial
sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>We expect
companies to help their investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this
issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business
and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to
climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our
engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related
disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities</div>
<div>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within
legal and regulatory limits, in order to influence public policy consistent with the companies’ values and strategies, and thus serve shareholders’ best long-term economic interests. These activities can create risks, including: the
potential for allegations of corruption; the potential for reputational issues associated with a candidate, party, or issue; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory , and compliance considerations associated with corporate political
activity. We believe that companies which choose to engage in political activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and to mitigate risks, including a level of board oversight.</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder proposals requesting increased
disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view regarding the associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards
and management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may decide to support a shareholder proposal requesting
additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or actual harm to shareholders’ interests, and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with
sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk.</div>
<div>Finally, we believe that it is not the role of shareholders to
suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div>
<div>GENERAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS</div>
<div>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</div>
<div>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains
items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best long-term economic interests.</div>
<div>Bundled proposals</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the opportunity to
review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BlackRock may reject certain positive changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict
or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Exclusive forum provisions</div>
<div>BlackRock generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum
for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote against the independent chair or lead independent director and
members of the governance committee.</div> <div>Multi-jurisdictional
companies</div> <div>Where a company is listed on multiple
exchanges or incorporated in a country different from its primary listing, we will seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific proposals</div> </div>
<div type="Block"> <div>A-26</div> </div>
</div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>on the shareholder meeting
agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs itself, and the market context of each specific proposal on the agenda. If the relevant
standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. We expect that companies will disclose the rationale for their
selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, in particular where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</div>
<div>Other business</div>
<div>We oppose giving companies our proxy to vote on matters where
we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</div>
<div>Reincorporation</div>
<div>Proposals to reincorporate from one state or country to
another are most frequently motivated by considerations of anti - takeover protections, legal advantages, and / or cost savings. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to
reincorporate. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charter / articles / bylaws to assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections
are diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</div>
<div>IPO governance</div>
<div>We expect boards to consider and disclose how the corporate
governance structures adopted upon initial public offering (“IPO”) are in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also expect boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and control structures, such that boards
might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our <font>letter on unequal voting structures</font>, we articulate
our view that “one vote for one share” is the preferred structure for publicly -traded companies. We also recognize the potential benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, we believe
that these structures should have a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we believe that such arrangements may not be in the
best interest of shareholders in the long-term.</div> <div>We will
typically apply a one-year grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, director independence and over-boarding considerations), during which we expect boards to take steps to bring
corporate governance standards in line with our expectations.</div>
<div>Further, if a company qualifies as an emerging growth company
(an “EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted under the JOBS Act for the duration such a company is
categorized as an EGC. We expect an EGC to have a totally independent audit committee by the first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and audit -related issues applicable in full for an EGC on the first
anniversary of its IPO.</div> <div>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS</div>
<div>Amendment to charter / articles / bylaws</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the right to vote on
key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms and amendments to the charter / articles / bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a
reasonable period of time, in particular if those changes have the potential to impact shareholder rights ( see “Director elections” herein). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes to the charter / articles /
bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance structure.</div>
<div>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make
changes to the charter / articles / bylaws, we will consider in part the company’s and / or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes, the company’s governance profile and history, relevant jurisdictional laws, and
situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>changes, among other
factors. We will typically support changes to the charter / articles / bylaws where the benefits to shareholders, including the costs of failing to make those changes, demonstrably outweigh the costs or risks of making such changes.</div>
<div>Proxy access</div>
<div>We believe that long-term shareholders should have the
opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</div>
<div>In our view, securing the right of shareholders to nominate
directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, stimulate board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of
directing that attention where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that
the mechanism will not be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking to take control of the board.</div>
<div>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access
proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a
standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</div>
<div>Right to act by written consent</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad
support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to solicit votes by written consent
provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of
outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent. We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion
of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder
proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that we believe offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without
having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</div> <div>Right
to call a special meeting</div> <div>In exceptional circumstances
and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to call
a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of 15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called, in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in
addressing narrowly supported interests. However, we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others. We generally believe that a right to act via written consent
is not a sufficient alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</div>
<div>Simple majority voting</div>
<div>We generally favor a simple majority voting requirement to
pass proposals. Therefore, we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect their economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations
where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may support supermajority requirements in those situations.</div> </div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an “Underlying
Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at
their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (including any
portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities” or “Creation Basket”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash
Component”) (other than the iShares India 50 ETF, which currently issues Creation Units of its shares solely for cash). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe
BZX”), The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) (each, a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be
at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creation and Redemption of</font> <font>Creation Units-Role of
the Authorized Participant</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI) (other than
the iShares India 50 ETF, which currently redeems Creation Units of its shares solely for cash). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 250,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The Trust
reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in
advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such
collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that
include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with
the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of each Fund may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Listing
Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period
beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)
any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing
Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively
managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>The iShares India 50 ETF seeks to achieve its objective by
investing all its assets that are invested in Indian securities in a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the Republic of Mauritius (the “Subsidiary”). BFA serves as investment adviser to both the Fund and the Subsidiary. Unless otherwise
indicated, references made in this SAI to the iShares India 50 ETF refer to the Subsidiary and/or the Fund as applicable.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of
the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>
<div>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain
instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares Asia 50 ETF, iShares
Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares
Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF, iShares International Dividend Growth ETF, and iShares Latin America 40 ETF, along with certain
other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New York Mellon (“BNY”), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be used for temporary or
emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</font></div>
<div>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit may be
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. As part of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), discontinued two USD LIBOR
settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be
published after June 30, 2023. While the FCA is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings, potentially to include USD settings, on a “synthetic” basis, the “synthetic” methodology is not based on panel bank
contributions and is not intended to be representative of the interest rates in the underlying market. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if LIBOR ceases to be published or representative before the termination of the credit agreement,
LIBOR would be replaced under the terms of the credit agreement by a variable rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s
portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh
the current reduced return.</div> <div>Certain types of borrowings
by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants
would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of
outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A
currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon
by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon exchange rate and the
market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified future
time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures contracts will be maintained. Each Fund
does not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S. currency
futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</font></div>
<div>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of
risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and prices, can occur in such markets within very short
periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by foreign governments through regulation of
local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange
transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<td>The iShares Global 100 ETF
intends to be diversified in approximately the same proportion as its Underlying Index is diversified. The iShares Global 100 ETF may become non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market
capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of its Underlying Index. Shareholder approval will not be sought if the iShares Global 100 ETF crosses from diversified to non-diversified status due solely to a change in its relative
market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of its Underlying Index. The Funds disclose their portfolio holdings and weightings at www.iShares.com. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval. However, while the iShares Global 100 ETF is classified as
“diversified,” under applicable no-action relief from the SEC staff, the fund may become non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more
constituents of its Underlying Index and such a change does not require shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum
distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment
objectives.</div> <div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities
Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may
enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>under the Commodity
Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject
to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the <font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font>section of this SAI for more information.</div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures
contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon
termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to
close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery
obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the
underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be
accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the
exercise price of the option on the futures contract.</div>
<div>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on
a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the
underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put
options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are
traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is
no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out
Events”).</div> <div>Investments in futures contracts and
other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to
its obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid</div> </div>

least equal to the Fund’s daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value
(<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were
required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any
changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or
other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more expensive.</div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>
 Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market
value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total assets (including the value
of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned
securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing dividends paid on securities
loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received
on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>
 Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the
“Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has
appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a “highly liquid
investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The Liquidity Rule defines
“liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is
determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as
defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div> </div>

Securities.<font>  Each Fund intends to purchase publicly-traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the Fund's investment in such stocks may be in the form
of American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) and European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”) (collectively, “depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts are receipts,
typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are
issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks
and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered
form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the
world.</font></div> <div>Depositary receipts are generally subject
to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to additional risks associated with the
non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs,
which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored
depositary receipts.</div> <div>Investing in the securities of
non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory
taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be
subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (“GDP”), rate of inflation,
capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”) or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with
respect to the Funds.</div> <div>The iShares Asia 50 ETF, iShares
Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares International Developed Property ETF, and iShares Latin America ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have
investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA ( the term “underlying fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is
not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), business development companies, and investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing),
and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action
letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the advisor of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator”
until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the advisor of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for such Fund to rely on this
no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of such Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under
comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be
phased in through September 1, 2022. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to
impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, a
Fund is currently required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that
derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are
performed on a net basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by
a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing
the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“Rule 18f-4”). The Funds will be required to implement and comply with Rule 18f-4 by August 19, 2022. Once implemented, Rule 18f-4 will impose limits on the amount of derivatives
a fund can enter into, eliminate the asset segregation framework currently used by funds to comply with Section 18 of the 1940 Act, treat derivatives as senior securities and require funds whose use of derivatives is more than a limited specified
exposure amount to establish and maintain a comprehensive derivatives risk management program and appoint a derivatives risk manager.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to
repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by
the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally
strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same</font></div> </div>

Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund's exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a value
equal to or greater than the Fund's obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional
securities.</div> <div>Securities of Investment Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment
companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a
Fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not
limited to, money market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for
operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. In addition, the iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, in order to improve its portfolio liquidity and its ability to
track its Underlying Index, may invest up to 10% of its assets in shares of other iShares funds that provide exposure similar to certain of the markets included in its Underlying Index. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees and
expenses in an amount equal to the iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF's pro rata share of the fees and expenses attributable to the Fund's investments in other iShares funds. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses
of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro
rata</font><font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that
may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including
government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs), bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv)
commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc., “F-1” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or “A-1”
by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible
corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been
determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.
branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits
maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap
agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to make periodic payments to the
first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount
of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the
accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including
currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for difference or “CFDs”). The use of swaps is a highly specialized
activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div> </div>

Stocks.<font>  A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or operating division within a larger company and is designed to “track” the
performance of such business unit or division. The tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However,
holders of the tracking stock may not have the same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding
that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market.
The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce
a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk. <font> Custody
risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make
trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of
their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In
general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed
markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted
by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to
recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for
compensation.</font></div> <div>Dividend Risk.<font>  There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will be paid, or that they will either remain at current levels or increase over
time.</font></div> <div>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. <font> A Fund's strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not
required to continue to pay dividends on such stocks. Therefore, there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future or an anticipated acceleration of dividends may not occur. Depending upon
market conditions, dividend-paying stocks that meet the Fund’s investment criteria may not be widely available and/or may be highly concentrated in only a few market sectors.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk.<font>
 Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven
calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program
as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions
be taken.</div> <div>LIBOR Risk.
<font> A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment
value. A Fund’s investments may pay interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a
Fund may also reference LIBOR.</font></div> <div>LIBOR Replacement
Risk. <font> As part of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), discontinued two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication
on December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. While the
FCA is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings, potentially to include USD settings, on a “synthetic” basis, the “synthetic” methodology is not based on panel bank contributions and is not intended to be
representative of the interest rates in the underlying market. A Fund may have investments linked to other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (“EONIA”), which may also cease to be published. Various
financial industry groups continue planning for the transition away from LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain securities and transactions to a new reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”),
which is intended to replace USD LIBOR.</font></div> <div>In June
2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which includes various private-market participants working with the Federal Reserve, announced its selection of the new SOFR, which is intended to be a broad measure of secured overnight U.S. Treasury
repo rates, as its recommendation for an appropriate replacement for USD LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR in 2018, and it has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. At times,
SOFR has proven to be more volatile than the 3-month USD LIBOR. Working groups and regulators in other countries have suggested other alternatives for their markets, including the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (“SONIA”) in
England.</div> <div>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition
process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. The transition process might lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of, new hedges placed against, instruments whose terms currently include LIBOR.
While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such
alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting
provisions in certain existing instruments. Global regulators have advised market participants to cease entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate, and it is possible that investments in LIBOR-based instruments could invite
regulatory scrutiny. In addition, a liquid market for newly issued instruments that use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. Instruments with fallback provisions (<font>i.e.</font>, contractual
provisions specifying the trigger events for a transition to a replacement rate) to facilitate the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may also include adjustments that do not adequately compensate the holder for the different
characteristics of the alternative reference rate. As a result, the fallback provision causes a value transfer from one party to the instrument to the counterparty. Because the usefulness of LIBOR as a benchmark could decline during the transition
period, these and related adverse effects could occur with respect to particular LIBOR settings as they are phased out. There may also be challenges for a Fund to enter into hedging transactions against such newly issued instruments until a market
for such hedging transactions develops. The effect of any changes to, or discontinuation of, LIBOR on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, (1) existing fallback or termination provisions in individual contracts and the potential
renegotiation of existing contracts and (2) whether, how, and when industry participants develop and adopt new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products and instruments. A Fund's investments may also be tied to other interbank
offered rates and currencies, which may face similar issues. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform the same as LIBOR because the alternative
reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component in the rate calculation. Alternative reference rates generally reflect the performance of the market for U.S. Treasury securities, which are secured by the U.S. Treasury, and not the
interbank lending markets. Therefore, in the event of a credit crisis, floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those instruments using a rate indexed to the interbank lending market. In
addition, legislation may affect the transition of LIBOR-based instruments by permitting trustees and calculation agents to transition instruments with no LIBOR transition language to an alternative reference rate selected by such agents. Such</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>legislation, which has
been enacted in some jurisdictions, generally includes safe harbors from liability, meaning that a Fund may have limited recourse if the alternative reference rate does not fully compensate the Fund for the transition of an instrument from LIBOR.
All of the aforementioned may adversely affect a Fund’s performance or NAV.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA
and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively impact the
Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel and
resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to
disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
occurrence or effects.</font></div> <div>Risk of Derivatives.<font>  A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a
measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other derivatives. Compared
to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities.
Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to
prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a
Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate
gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying
security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Equity Securities.<font>
 An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of stock
markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to increases and decreases in
value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular investors or groups of investors (for example,
retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or significant “short” positions taken by institutional investors). Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt
obligations because common stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically
have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock
price to decline.</font></div> <div>Although most of the securities
in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a
market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund’s shares will be adversely
affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are wide.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures
contracts may be closed only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market
will exist for the contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future
and the movement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may
have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered stock index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they
invest.</div> <div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by
a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy
of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the
daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little
or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. <font> An investment in each Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic
and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in
currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include
favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in the Funds also involves certain
risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price
volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; in the case of the iShares India 50 ETF,
restrictions on ownership of Indian and other foreign countries' securities by foreign entities; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower
liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of
inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of Swap
Agreements.<font>  The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap
counterparty will default on its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could
affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to
receive).</font></div> <div>A Fund is required to post and collect
variation margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Initial margin requirements are in the process of being phased in, and a Fund may be subject to such requirements as early as
September 2021. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Treaty/Tax Risk.<font>  The
iShares India 50 ETF operates, in part, through the Subsidiary, which in turn invests in securities of Indian issuers. The Subsidiary should be eligible to take advantage of the benefits of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement between India and
Mauritius (“DTAA”) in relation to investments in shares made until March 31, 2017. Numerous investors have relied on the benefits of the DTAA to invest in India through Mauritius in the past.</font></div>
<div>An investor is required to submit the tax residency
certificate (“TRC”) as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government of India to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div>
<div>Under the DTAA, India has the right to tax capital gains that
arise from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident. However, the DTAA provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before April 1, 2017. The application of such provisions of the DTAA could result
in the imposition of withholding and capital gains taxes and/or other taxes on the Subsidiary by tax authorities in India. This could significantly reduce the return to the iShares India 50 ETF on its investments in shares and the return received by
the Fund’s shareholders. The Indian government has notified the Multilateral Instrument to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the “MLI”), which would apply and modify tax treaties which have been notified by
both the countries, being parties to the tax treaty, as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”). However, Mauritius has not notified its tax treaty with India as a CTA; therefore the MLI will not apply to the DTAA. India and Mauritius may again
renegotiate the DTAA, which could impact the returns received by the Fund on its investments and returns received by the shareholders of the Fund.</div>
<div>Criteria for Residence of Companies in India.</div>
<div>A foreign company will be considered a resident in India if
its place of effective management (“POEM”) (defined as a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made) is in India in the relevant
financial year. This test is to be applied taking the relevant financial year as a whole into consideration. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (“CBDT”) has clarified that the provisions of POEM shall not apply to a company having
turnover of INR 500 million or less in a year.</div> <div>Indirect
Transfers.</div> <div>The Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT
Act”) imposes Indian tax and withholding obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (“indirect transfers”).</div>
<div>It has been clarified that the share or interest of the
foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity.
The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. The fair market value will be determined in accordance with the final Rule 11UB of the Income Tax Rules, 1962
(“IT Rules”). It has also been provided that where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in
India. The indirect transfer shall not be applicable in following cases:</div> <div>

<div>If the gains arising from transfer of share or interest in a
foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</div>
<div>Gains realized when a non-resident acquires shares of a
foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of the value of the
company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div>
<div>Because the iShares India 50 ETF invests in Indian securities
through the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the iShares India 50 ETF may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets. Accordingly, shareholder redemptions of the iShares India 50 ETF shares and sales of the iShares India
50 ETF shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations. However, non-resident investors, investing directly or indirectly in Category I Foreign Portfolio Investors (“FPI”), registered under SEBI (Foreign Portfolio
Investors) Regulations, 2019 (“2019 Regulations”), are exempt from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation under the IT Act. The Subsidiary has been registered as a Category I FPI under the 2019 Regulations. Therefore, any
redemptions or transfers by the iShares India 50 ETF or by shareholders in the iShares India 50 ETF should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax.</div>
<div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules.</div>
<div>The current legislation provides for the general
anti-avoidance rules (“GAAR”) to curb aggressive tax planning with the use of sophisticated structures. CBDT has clarified that where a FPI (such as the Subsidiary) is located in a particular jurisdiction based on non-tax commercial
reasons and the main purpose of the choice of location/residence of the FPI is not to obtain a treaty benefit, the GAAR provisions will not be resorted to by the tax authorities.</div>
<div>As per the provisions of GAAR, an arrangement entered into by
a taxpayer may be declared to be an impermissible avoidance arrangement, if the “main purpose” of the arrangement is to obtain a “tax benefit” and the arrangement:</div> <div>

<div>Risk of Investing in Mid-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a
larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments,
and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it more difficult for the Funds to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Small-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies, and, therefore, a Fund's share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a larger percentage of
their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies to adverse
business and economic developments. The stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Funds to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than
larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization
companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Africa.<font>
 Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or
military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries, genocidal
warfare.</font></div> <div>Certain countries in Africa generally
have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of countries in Africa are generally
underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market
capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended altogether.</div>
<div>Market volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a
small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to effect securities transactions through these brokerage
firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (<font>i.e., </font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund effects
securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</div>
<div>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control
to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign
investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes
available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may
not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>than investing in issuers
located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and
regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are
generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed countries.</div>
<div>In addition, governments of certain countries in Africa in
which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign
withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.</div>
<div>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater
degree of risk associated with governmental approval in connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s
balance of payments declines, such African country may impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other
actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</div>
<div>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new
and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by
new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in
Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such countries may not receive many of the protections available to
shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems
of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary
commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a
Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a
result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise
substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Recent political instability
and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries in those countries and adversely impacted the
region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly through the region, and that
developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to</div> </div>

Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>
  Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and
there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also
developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has
recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this
region.</div> <div>Certain governments in this region administer
prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control
many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China
and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the
market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with
certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily
dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative
impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in Brazil. <font> Investment in securities of companies domiciled in Brazil involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets.
Such heightened risks include, among others, a high level of price volatility in the Brazilian equity and currency markets, chronic structural public sector deficits, a rising unemployment rate and disparities of wealth.</font></div>
<div>Brazil has historically experienced high rates of inflation
and may continue to do so in the future. An increase in prices for commodities, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency (the real) and potential future governmental measures seeking to maintain the value of the real in relation to the U.S.
dollar, may trigger increases in inflation in Brazil and may slow the rate of growth of the Brazilian economy. Inflationary pressures also may limit the ability of certain Brazilian issuers to access foreign financial markets and may lead to further
government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that may adversely affect the overall performance of the Brazilian economy, which in turn could adversely affect a Fund's investments.</div>
<div>The Brazilian government has exercised, and continues to
exercise, significant influence over the Brazilian economy, which may have significant effects on Brazilian companies and on market conditions and prices of Brazilian securities. The Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and
occasionally drastic, intervention by the Brazilian government. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the core of Brazil’s economy. The Brazilian government’s
actions to control inflation and affect other economic policies have involved, among others, the setting of wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, fluctuation of the base interest rates, imposing exchange controls and limiting
imports into Brazil. In the past, the Brazilian government has maintained domestic price controls, and no assurances can be given that price controls will not be re-imposed in the future.</div>
<div>Investments in Brazilian securities may be subject to certain
restrictions on foreign investment. Brazilian law provides that whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign
investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. The likelihood of such restrictions may be affected by the extent of Brazil’s foreign currency reserves, the size of
Brazil’s debt service burden relative to the economy as a whole, and political constraints to which Brazil may be subject. There can be no assurance that the Brazilian government will not impose restrictions or restrictive exchange control
policies in the future, which could have the effect of preventing or restricting access to foreign currency.</div>
<div>The market for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by
the flow of international capital, and economic and market conditions of certain countries, especially other emerging market countries in Central and South America. Adverse economic conditions or developments in other emerging market countries have
at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in Brazil. Crises in neighboring emerging market countries
also may increase investors’ risk aversion, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by Brazilian companies, including securities in which a Fund may invest.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. <font> The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and political
instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive
to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain
countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values
and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition,
certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and</div> </div>

or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its
reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China.
<font> Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks
include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring
countries.</font></div> <div>Military conflicts, either in response
to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since
1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, and social framework. Recent protests and
unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. China has a complex territorial dispute
regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In
addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored
cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or
Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause
uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the performance of the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic
reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be
effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Chinese companies, such as
those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. The Chinese government continues to maintain a
major role in economic policymaking. Investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital
invested.</div> <div>In addition, there is less regulation and
monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to
the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and
accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and
applying the relevant regulation.</div> <div>The Chinese government
has taken positions that prevent the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) from inspecting the audit work and practices of accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong for compliance with U.S. law and professional
standards. Audits performed by PCAOB-registered accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong may be less reliable than those performed by firms subject to PCAOB inspection. Accordingly, information about the Chinese securities in which the Funds
invests may be less reliable or complete. Under amendments to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted in December 2020, which requires that the PCAOB be permitted to inspect the accounting firm of a U.S.-listed Chinese issuer, Chinese companies with
securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the accounting firm.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments based on
investor protection considerations.</div> <div>While the Chinese
economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy and securities
market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China
and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which a
Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national
security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or
securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions.</div>
<div>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of
China (“PRC”) are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as
consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on a Fund and its investors, particularly in
relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may be less rigorous, and may result in significant
differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.<font>  Certain Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (“SEHK”)), A-shares
(securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies
incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong listed securities known as
Red-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial
revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive
substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font></div>
<div>Certain Funds may also invest in Chinese companies listed on
U.S. exchanges, such as ADRs or variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are subject to the investment risks associated with the underlying Chinese issuer or operating company. Chinese operating companies listed on U.S. exchanges are
often structured as VIEs. Instead of directly owning the equity securities of a Chinese company, a VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the Chinese company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE
has no equity ownership of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating company into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could
significantly affect the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese company.</div>
<div>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two
classes: A-shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to greater government restrictions, including trading
suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares market is generally smaller and less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or
Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door listing” through Red-Chips
or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing
and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect.<font> </font></div> <div>The iShares Core
MSCI Total International Stock ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF and iShares MSCI Global Multifactor
ETF may invest in A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (“Shanghai Connect”) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (“Shenzhen Connect,” and together with Shanghai Connect, “Stock
Connect”). Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program with an aim to achieve mutual stock market access between the PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the
case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect), and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (“CSDCC”). Under Stock Connect, a Fund’s trading of eligible A-shares listed on the SSE or
the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong brokers. Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures, which could pose risks to a Fund.</div>
<div>Although no individual investment quotas or licensing
requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect, trading through Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the “Daily Quota”), which limits the maximum net purchases under Stock Connect each day. The Daily Quota does not belong to a
Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders for A-shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although a Fund will be permitted to sell A-shares regardless of the Daily Quota balance). The Daily Quota
may restrict a Fund’s ability to invest in A-shares through Stock Connect on a timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota is also subject to change.</div>
<div>A-shares purchased through Stock Connect generally may only be
sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market rules and to facilitate orderly operations of a Fund, including the timely settlement of Stock Connect
trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A-shares through Stock Connect. Such operating model may reduce the risks of trade failures; however, it will also
allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without the prior verification by a Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject a Fund to additional risks, including an increased risk of inadvertently exceeding certain trade or other restrictions
or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>While A-shares must be designated as eligible to be traded
through Stock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed on the SSE, the “SSE Securities,” and such eligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the “SZSE Securities”), those A-shares may also lose such designation, and if this occurs,
such A-shares may be sold but could no longer be purchased through Stock Connect. With respect to sell orders through Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A-shares in its account before the market
opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A-shares in an investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact a Fund’s performance.</div>
<div>In addition, Stock Connect operates only on days when both the
Chinese and the Hong Kong markets are open for trading and when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement days. Therefore, an investment in A-shares through Stock Connect may subject a Fund to the risk of price
fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets are open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading through Stock Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is
effected, a Fund’s ability to access A-shares through Stock Connect will be adversely affected. In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are closed on a U.S. trading day, a Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of
A-shares through Stock Connect in a timely manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s performance.</div>
<div>A Fund’s investments in A-shares through Stock Connect
are held by its custodian in accounts in the Central Clearing and Settlement System (“CCASS”) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), which in turn holds the A-shares, as the nominee holder,
through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with the CSDCC. The precise nature and rights of a Fund as the beneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There
is a lack of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership and beneficial ownership under PRC law and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in the PRC</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>courts. The exact nature
and methods of enforcement of the rights and interests of a Fund under PRC law is also uncertain. In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities may
not be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of a Fund or as part of the general assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors.</div>
<div>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary
interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still treat HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions
in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities. HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS informed of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take
steps in order to participate in them. A Fund will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and notification and implementation of corporate actions.</div>
<div>The HKSCC is responsible for the clearing, settlement and
provision of depositary, nominee and other related services of the trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors. Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE Securities directly; rather, they are held through their
brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The HKSCC and the CSDCC establish clearing links and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC
be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against the CSDCC. In that event, a Fund may
suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses from the CSDCC.</div>
<div>Market participants are able to participate in Stock Connect
subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the “connectivity” in Stock Connect requires the routing of
orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires the development of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no assurance that these systems will function properly or will
continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A-shares through Stock Connect could be disrupted, and a Fund’s ability to achieve its investment
objective may be adversely affected.</div> <div>The Shanghai
Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December 2016, do not have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities and implementation
rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to how the current regulations will be applied or interpreted going forward, and new or revised regulations may be issued from time to time by the regulators and
stock exchanges in China and Hong Kong in connection with operations, legal enforcement and cross-border trades under Stock Connect. In addition, there can be no assurance that Stock Connect will not be discontinued. A Fund may be adversely affected
as a result of such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes and legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, different fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors
acquiring A-shares through Stock Connect, and these fees, costs and taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities providing similar investment exposure.</div>
<div>A-Share Market Suspension Risk.</div>
<div>A-shares may only be bought from, or sold to, a Fund at times
when the relevant A-shares may be sold or purchased on the relevant Chinese stock exchange. The A-shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks could
lead to greater market execution risk, valuation risks and liquidity risks and costs for a Fund, as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of the Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily limit, set at 10%, of
the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of A-shares during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not restrict trading within the relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid market on an
exchange will exist for any particular A-share or for any particular time. This could increase a Fund’s tracking error and/or cause a Fund to trade in the market at greater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV. Given that the A-shares market is considered volatile and unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and redemption of Creation Units may also be disrupted.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing
stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it
difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public
expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely
on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market
countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may
have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe. <font> Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe. Certain
Eastern European countries have high public debt levels, significant underground economies, high unemployment and emigration of skilled workers. Such countries generally have a history of political instability, limited infrastructure and an
inefficient public sector prone to endemic corruption. Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments have
expropriated substantial amounts of private property, and many claims of the property owners have never been fully settled.</font></div>
<div>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market
economies at different paces with different characteristics. Many Eastern European securities markets are generally underdeveloped with low, irregular trading volumes, dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate
information. Eastern European securities markets are generally subject to less government supervision and regulation and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in the U.S. or Western European countries. Legal institutions
governing private and foreign investments and private property may be relatively nascent, inefficient, and unevenly enforced or inequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the
private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on a Fund’s investments. Information and
transaction costs, differential taxes, and sometimes political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor.</div>
<div>Geopolitical events and other instability in certain Eastern
European countries may cause uncertainty in the region’s financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. These markets may be particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and
currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia has historically asserted its influence in the region using diplomatic, informational, military, and
economic (DIME) instruments of national power, as it did with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014.</div>
<div>Eastern European economies may also be particularly
susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their reliance on bank related inflows of capital. Changes to the economies of countries with substantial foreign direct investment in certain Eastern European countries may
negatively affect the region’s economy. The economy of certain Eastern European countries may be adversely affected by global prices for manufactured goods or commodity prices decline to the extent that a country relies on the export of such
products.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Investing in Emerging Markets. <font>  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic
stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers
may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make
dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing
restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for
investigations into or litigation against companies and investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy
judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a
regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments based on investor protection
considerations.</font></div> <div>Emerging market securities
markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited
number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some
emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities
across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily
undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness
of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute
to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the
price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and
corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in
governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private
property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax
policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some
cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</div>
<div>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement
procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have significant
operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union (the “EU”). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”)
(the “eurozone”) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of
which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in
the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading
partners. Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The
European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited
to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute “capital controls.” Countries may use
these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of
that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were
downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member
states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic
recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In
addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the
value of a Fund’s investments in the region.  The United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship
effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade
agreement, such as financial services. A Fund faces risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect
European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Brexit has also led to
legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could
adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience
heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to
greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly
strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by
disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and
significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value
and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing
in India. <font> India is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to more developed markets. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India.
India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries, including Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states,
including Kashmir. Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets offer higher potential for losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the
economic conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by a Fund. The securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed
companies with small market capitalization, greater price volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more developed markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S.
or other, more developed countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or the Fund’s ability to track its
Underlying Index.</font></div> <div>Global factors and foreign
actions may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian companies, which may decrease the liquidity of a Fund’s
portfolio and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial markets. These factors,
coupled with the lack of extensive accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices, as applicable in the U.S., may increase the risk of loss for a Fund.</div>
<div>Securities laws in India are relatively new and unsettled and,
as a result, there is a risk of significant and unpredictable change in laws governing foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in particular may be adversely affected by new or amended
laws and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), the central government and the tax authorities (to the extent that tax benefits need to be
utilized), may be required before a Fund can make investments in Indian companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</div>
<div>Technology and software sectors represent a significant
portion of the total capitalization of the Indian securities markets. The value of these companies will generally fluctuate in response to technological and regulatory developments, and, as a result, a Fund’s holdings are expected to
experience correlated fluctuations.</div> <div>Natural disasters,
such as tsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in India or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Indian economy or operations of a Subsidiary, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Latin America. <font> A number of Latin American countries are among the largest debtors of developing countries and have a long history of foreign debt and default. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on its debt and many investors suffered
significant losses.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The
majority of the region's economies have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and loans from external sources to fuel their state-sponsored economic plans. Historically, government profligacy and ill-conceived plans for modernization have
exhausted these resources with little benefit accruing to the economy. Most countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their debt obligations. In addition, interest on the debt is subject to market conditions and may
reach levels that would impair economic activity and create a difficult and costly environment for borrowers. Accordingly, these governments may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment, which could negatively affect local markets.
Because of their dependence on foreign credit and loans, a number of Latin American economies face significant economic difficulties and some economies fell into recession as the recent global economic crisis tightened international credit supplies.
While the region has recently shown signs of economic improvement, recovery from past economic downturns in Latin America has historically been slow, and any such recovery, if sustained, may be gradual.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Latin American
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments and difficulties in enforcing legal judgments in non-U.S. courts. Legal remedies available to investors in certain Latin American countries may be
less extensive than those available to investors in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, certain Latin American countries may have legal systems that may make it difficult for the Fund to vote proxies, exercise shareholder rights, and pursue
legal remedies with respect to its investments. In the past, many Latin American countries have experienced substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. For companies that keep accounting records in the local
currency, inflation accounting rules in some Latin American countries require, for both tax and accounting purposes, that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the company’s balance sheet in order to express items in terms of currency
of constant purchasing power. Inflation accounting may indirectly generate losses or profits for certain Latin American companies.</div>
<div>Certain Latin American countries have entered into regional
trade agreements that are designed to, among other things, reduce barriers between countries, increase competition among companies and reduce government subsidies in certain industries. No assurance can be given that these changes will be successful
in the long term, or that these changes will result in the economic stability intended. There is a possibility that these trade arrangements will not be fully implemented, or will be partially or completely unwound. It is also possible that a
significant participant could choose to abandon a trade agreement, which could diminish its credibility and influence. Any of these occurrences could have adverse effects on the markets of both participating and non-participating countries,
including sharp appreciation or depreciation of participants’ national currencies and a significant increase in exchange rate volatility, a resurgence in economic protectionism, an undermining of confidence in the Latin American markets, an
undermining of Latin American economic stability, the collapse or slowdown of the drive towards Latin American economic unity, and/or reversion of the attempts to lower government debt and inflation rates that were introduced in anticipation of such
trade agreements. Such developments could have an adverse impact on a Fund’s investments in Latin America generally or in specific countries participating in such trade agreements.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mexico.
<font> Investment in Mexican issuers involves risks that are specific to Mexico, including regulatory, political, currency and economic risks. In the past, Mexico has experienced high interest rates, economic
volatility, significant devaluation of its currency (the peso), and high unemployment rates. The Mexican economy, among other things, is dependent upon external trade with other economies, specifically with the U.S.  and certain Latin American
countries. Recent political developments in the U.S. have potential implications for the current trade arrangements between the U.S. and Mexico, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund.</font></div>
<div>As a result, Mexico is dependent on, among other things, the
U.S. economy and the economies of other Central and South American countries, and any change in the price or demand for Mexican exports may have an adverse impact on the Mexican economy. Because commodities such as oil and gas, minerals and metals
represent a large portion of the region’s exports, the economies of these countries are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. For example, lower prices have negatively impacted Petróleos Mexicanos, the Mexican
state-owned petroleum company, which accounts for approximately 30% of the Mexican government’s revenue.</div>
<div>Mexico’s economy has become increasingly oriented toward
manufacturing, including electronic equipment and machinery, in the years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) entered into force. As Mexico’s top export is automotive vehicles, its economy is strongly tied to
the U.S. automotive market, and changes to certain segments in the U.S. market could have an impact on the Mexican economy. In addition, political developments, including the implementation of</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>tariffs by the U.S. and
the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities
held by the Fund. The automotive industry and other industrial products can be highly cyclical, and companies in these industries may suffer periodic operating losses. These industries can be significantly affected by labor relations and fluctuating
component prices.</div> <div>The agricultural and mining sectors of
Mexico’s economy also account for a large portion of its exports; Mexico is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in the price and demand for agricultural products and natural resources. In addition, Mexico has privatized or has begun the
process of privatization of certain entities and industries, and some investors have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust to a competitive environment and changing regulatory standards.</div>
<div>Recently, Mexico has experienced an outbreak of violence
related to criminal gang activity, drug trafficking and terrorist actions. Violence near border areas, border-related political disputes, and other social upheaval may lead to strained international relations. Incidents involving Mexico’s
security may have an adverse effect on the Mexican economy and cause uncertainty in its financial markets. Mexico has also experienced contentious and very closely decided elections. Changes in political parties and other political events may affect
the economy and contribute to additional instability.</div> <div>Risk
of Investing in the Middle East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies
in the Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas
and foreign currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised
and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, including some of the largest companies in the country.
Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in the Fund's
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the
earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and
financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. Each Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its
rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental
approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with
other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern
countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of
the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has
increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020,
could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on
the value of certain securities held by a Fund.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in Russia. <font> Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be
considered highly speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in
Russia as a result of expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national
interests; and potentially greater price volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would
not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and
more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the Russian court system.</font></div>
<div>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic,
political and social instability than is the case in other developed countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military involvement in political and economic decision-making,
including changes in government through extra-constitutional means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations with neighboring countries;
and (v) ethnic, religious and racial disaffection.</div> <div>The
Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable
to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia</div> </div>

amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</div>
<div>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over
many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also
the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its regional geopolitical influence (including military steps).
Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Such steps may increase tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may negatively affect
economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For example, the U.S.
has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions
like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Russian economy. </div>
<div>Russia Sanctions.<font> The U.S.
and the EMU of the EU, along with the regulatory bodies of a number of countries including Japan, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and Canada (collectively, “Sanctioning Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which consist of
prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, with certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could also
institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian
economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. </font></div>
<div>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include
prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of
such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind
deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund's transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</div>
<div>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund's
Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or
increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be able to effectively implement a
representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking
counter measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially lower prices
for its securities.</div> <div>These sanctions may also lead to
changes in a Fund’s Underlying Index. A Fund’s index provider may remove securities from its Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent economic sanctions. In such an event,
it is expected that a Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with its Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These sanctions, the volatility that may
result in the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause a Fund to invest in, or increase a Fund’s investments in, depositary receipts that represent
the securities of its Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Investing in South Korea. <font> Investments in South Korean issuers involve risks that are specific to South Korea, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. Substantial
political tensions exist between North Korea and South Korea. Escalated tensions involving the two nations and the outbreak of hostilities between the two nations, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect
on the South Korean economy. In addition, South Korea's economic growth potential has recently been on a decline, because of a rapidly aging population and structural problems, among other factors. The South Korean economy is heavily reliant on
trading exports and disruptions or decreases in trade activity could lead to further declines.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. <font> The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may be, at times, excess
capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. government, while others
formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased pension
liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. Companies in
the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of
exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and
product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental
policies.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Biotechnology
Industry. <font> Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that
intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology
industry spend heavily on research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly. The risks of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a
result of managed care pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent losses during the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to regulatory
approval processes or regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology companies may be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability claims.
Companies involved in the biotechnology industry may be subject to extensive government regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among other foreign and
domestic regulators. Such regulation may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product development and approval of products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. <font> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication
services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services and products including television
broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital
requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes
can drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking
and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </font></div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>regulatory requirements
may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The communications services industry
can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product
obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter
distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain
communications companies obsolete.</div> <div>Telecommunications
providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage
to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other
negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic
joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </div>
<div>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be
significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted
individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for
media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. <font> A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail companies, and housing-related
companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends, marketing
campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Defensive Industry. <font> A Fund is subject to risks faced by companies in the consumer defensive industry, including: governmental regulation affecting the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods, which could
affect profitability; new laws or litigation that may adversely affect tobacco companies; fads, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting supply and demand that may strongly affect securities prices and profitability of food, beverage and
fashion related products; and international events that may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home,
personal and office products, clothing and textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and
consumer disposable income. The consumer goods industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability of
certain companies in the consumer goods industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely
affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry
may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> <div>The energy sector is cyclical and is
highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices
have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential
limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of
certain crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims.
Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in
addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest,</div> </div>

Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant
impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by governmental agencies. Such
regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may materially adversely affect the financial
performance of companies in the energy sector.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions,
specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial
conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</font></div>
<div>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector,
including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in
many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be
predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses
are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government
regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the
financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and
counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the financial services companies. Financial services companies may have
significant exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other companies with exposure to the same borrower or
counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse
cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative
perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain
financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial
companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased government intervention. In addition, there is no
guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for
medical expenses, rising or falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments.
Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Home Construction Industry. <font> The home construction industry may be significantly affected by changes in government spending, zoning laws, economic conditions, interest rates, commodity prices, consumer confidence and spending, taxation,
demographic patterns, real estate values, overbuilding, housing starts, and new and existing home sales. Rising interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability to consumers, increasing foreclosure rates or increases in the costs of owning a home
could reduce the market for new homes and adversely affect the profitability of home construction companies. Different segments of the home construction industry can be significantly affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events
such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts. Home construction companies may lack diversification, due to ownership of a limited number of properties and concentration in a particular geographic region or property type.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the
industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and
investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the
industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>labor relations and
insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions
resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of
resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction,
unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than
the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Information
technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the
information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks are heightened for
information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> <div>Operations
Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Leverage
Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and
market value in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many
infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of its assets may be linked to
inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The
stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
transportation industry group.</font></div> <div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Materials
Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls, increased competition, depletion of
resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. Companies in the
materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks
are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Metals and Mining Industry. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in securities that are issued by and/or have exposure to, companies primarily involved in the metals and mining industry. Investments in metals and mining industry companies may be
speculative and subject to greater price volatility than investments in other types of companies. The profitability of companies in the metals and mining industry is related to, among other things, worldwide metal prices, and extraction and
production costs. Worldwide metal prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, so a Fund’s investment in metals and mining industry companies may be more volatile than other types of investments. In addition, metals and
mining companies may be significantly affected by changes in global demand for certain metals, economic developments, energy conservation, exchange rates, the success of exploration projects, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment,
government regulation and intervention, and world events in the regions that the companies to which a Fund has exposure operate (e.g., expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence and labor unrest). Metals and mining companies may also be subject to the effects of competitive pressures in the metals and mining industry.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Natural Resources Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the natural resources industry can be affected by worldwide energy prices, limits on exploration, and production spending. Companies in the natural resources industry are affected
by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural resources industry could be adversely affected by commodity price
volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. Companies in the natural resources industry may be adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological developments, and labor
relations.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas
Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas
production and conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such
services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in
relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may

industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In addition, the Middle
East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant portion of their
revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Pharmaceuticals Industry. <font> Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some companies in the
pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the
pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates. The process of obtaining government approvals may be long and costly. Many companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are heavily dependent on patents
and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and
similar claims.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Real
Estate Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies
(collectively, “Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are
organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various
risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>Distressed
Investment Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves
a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the
securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk.<font> Investing
in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Indian Tax Risk<font>: The IT Act
has been amended by the Finance Act, 2020 to tax the distributions made by REITS, out of the dividends received, in the hands of the unit holders. Earlier, a company distributing dividends to a REIT, was not liable to pay dividend distribution tax
on such dividends, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Such dividends were considered a pass through income for the REIT and the distributions made by the REIT to the unit holders from such dividends was also exempt from tax in the
hands of the non-resident unit holders.</font></div> <div>Pursuant
to the Finance Act, 2020, the dividend distribution tax has been abolished. Accordingly, under the amended IT Act, a company distributing dividends to a REIT would not be liable to pay dividend distribution tax irrespective of the satisfaction of
any condition. However, the amended IT Act provides that though such dividend income would continue to be treated as pass through income for the REIT, the distributions made from such dividends by the REITs may be taxed in the hands of the unit
holders (<font>i.e.</font> investors) in the REIT depending on the taxation regime adopted by the investee company. This may have a bearing on the returns of the Subsidiary and the Fund from investments in Indian
REITs.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Interest
Rate Risk.<font> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining
interest rates could result in increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements,
third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company.
Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial restrictions or
environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to
liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a
holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S.
Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the
REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that</font></div> </div>

qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. Because REITs often do not
provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise provided to you.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory
scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while
all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a
material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div> <div>Risk
of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental
regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the
area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition,
particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network
security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Timber and
Forestry Industry. <font> The market value of timber and forestry companies may be negatively affected by events occurring in nature and by international and local politics. Natural disasters such as wild fires,
volcanic eruptions, flooding, and severe weather conditions may affect the output of timber and timber-related products, and demand for timber and timber-related products in the U.S. and internationally may decrease due to new or changed tariffs,
quotas or trade agreements. Rising interest rates or unfavorable economic conditions could also negatively affect the prices of or demand for timber and timber-related products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>conditions can also have a
significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies
for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing
proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote
proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated
person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident
shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client
responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the
dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div>
<div>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy, the BlackRock
Global Proxy Voting Policies and the BlackRock U.S. Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendices A1, A2 and A3, respectively.</div>

Description.<font> The Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> is designed to measure the equity performance of the top 50 companies by free float market capitalization
whose equity securities trade in the Indian securities markets that are available to international investors on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (“NSE”). The securities in the Underlying Index are free float market
capitalization-weighted so that securities with higher total free float market capitalization have a larger representation in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Index Committee.<font> NSE Indices
Ltd. (formerly known as India Index Services &amp; Products Limited) (“NSEI”) indexes are primarily rules-based and monitored by a governing committee.</font></div>
<div>NSEI has constituted an Index Advisory Committee –
Equity that provides guidance on macro issues pertaining to equity indices. The Index Maintenance Subcommittee takes all decisions on additions and deletions of companies in indices.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Changes in
the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> level reflect changes in the free-float market capitalization of the constituents of the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> which are caused by stock price movements in the market. When a stock is replaced by another stock within the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup>, the index divisor is adjusted so the change in Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> market value that results from the
addition and deletion does not change the index level.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The Nifty
50 Index<sup>TM</sup> is calculated continuously and is available from major data vendors. For purposes of reporting performance of the Fund, the index provider will also make available to
the Fund Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> values in U.S. dollars on an end of day basis by applying a foreign exchange rate calculation to the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> as determined by the index provider.</font></div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font>
In addition to domicile within India and a listing on the NSE, component security selection decisions include the following criteria:</font></div>
<div><font>Eligible
Securities:</font></div> <div>Constituents of Nifty 100 Index that
are available for trading in NSE’s Futures &amp; Options segment are eligible for inclusion in the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup>.</div>
<div><font>Trading
Frequency:</font></div> <div>The company’s trading frequency
should be 100% in the last six months.</div> <div><font>Liquidity:</font></div>
<div>For inclusion in the index, the security should have traded at
an average impact cost of 0.50% or less during the last six months for 90% of the observations for a portfolio of 100 million Indian Rupees. Impact cost is the cost of executing a transaction in a security in proportion to its index weight, measured
by market capitalization at any point in time. This is the percentage mark-up suffered while buying/selling the desired quantity of a security compared to its ideal price – (best buy + best sell)/2.</div>
<div><font>Float-Adjusted Market
Capitalization:</font></div> <div>Companies will be eligible for
inclusion in the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM </sup>provided the average free-float market capitalization is at least 1.5 times the average free-float market capitalization of the smallest
constituent in the index.</div> <div><font>Listing History:</font></div>
<div>A company which comes out with an Initial Public Offering
(“IPO”) is eligible for inclusion in the index if it fulfills the normal eligibility criteria for the index – impact cost and float-adjusted market capitalization – for a three-month period instead of a six-month
period.</div> <div>The Morningstar Indexes</div>

<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 476</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup>, the Underlying
Index, is a dividend dollars weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of international equities selected based on a consistent history of growing dividends. The Underlying Index is a subset of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup>, which is a diversified broad market index that represents approximately
97% of the market capitalization in international developed and emerging markets. As of March 31, 2021, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following markets: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand,
Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the U.K. Eligible companies must pay a qualified dividend, must have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth and their earnings payout ratio must be less than 75%. Companies that are in the top
decile based on dividend yield are excluded from the Underlying Index prior to the dividend growth, payout ratio, and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) screens.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> The
Underlying Index methodology is as follows:</font></div> <div>(1) a
security must be a member of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup></div>
<div>(2) security must pay a qualified dividend (<font>e.g.</font>, REITs are excluded);</div>
<div>(3) top decile yield payers are excluded;</div>
<div>(4.1) apply dividend growth screen: must be currently paying
dividends and have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth; dividend growth condition is considered met if the trailing twelve months aggregated dividend increased from the previous to the current reconstitution date;</div>
<div>(4.2) spinoff exception to growth rule: for a current
constituent of the index, the requirement to raise dividend year-over-year to remain in the index after reconstitution will be waived if the constituent completed a spin-off in the preceding twelve months; any publicly trading spun-off entity of a
current constituent will be immediately included in the index, but it will have to start increasing its dividend starting with the year following the next reconstitution to remain in the index. The current constituent will not require dividend
growth in the spin-off year, where “year” means the twelve-month period between annual index reconstitutions;</div>
<div>(4.3) share repurchase exception to growth rule: for a current
constituent of the index, the requirement to raise dividend year-over-year to remain in the index after reconstitution will be waived if the constituent kept the dividend constant and executed share repurchases in the preceding twelve months
resulting in net decrease in its shares outstanding; this exception does not apply to constituents that decreased their dividend;</div>
<div>(5) apply growth sustainability screen: payout ratio must be
less than 75%, and must have positive consensus earnings forecast. Payout ratio is forward looking and is calculated by the trailing twelve month divided by the forward 12 month consensus earnings forecast;</div>
<div>(6) apply PFIC screen: exclude PFICs based on best efforts to
identify them;</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Component Selection Criteria for Domestic Indexes. <font>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC’s (“SPDJI”) various Index Committees are responsible for the overall management of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC's indices (“S&amp;P DJI Indices”). Issuers
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the “components”) selected for the Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&amp;P”) U.S. indexes
represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS<sup>®</sup>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end
funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of each constituent must trade on either the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ.
Additionally, only one share class per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes
combined for purposes of calculation of market capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i) ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, in
order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are capitalization-weighted,
based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted
market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s minimum market capitalization at the time
it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s components are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The
market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including private, corporate, and government holdings.</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for International Indexes. <font>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is balanced across country and sector
weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering approximately 95% of each country’s total market capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs
and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a candidate pool for index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The
specific securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked according to GICS. Then, the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market
capitalization methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s liquidity over a period of at least twelve months before consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added
immediately (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of the
sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s components are
adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including
private, corporate, and government holdings.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>With
respect to the non-U.S. components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which
represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 (Tokyo Stock Exchange) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly-listed issuers in the Japanese
equities market; (iii) S&amp;P/ASX All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four
major equities markets in Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets;
and (vi) the S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering approximately 70% of the region’s market capitalization.</div>
<div>Issue Changes. <font>General
oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to these
investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of index
changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance. <font>Maintaining
the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs. An issuer will be removed
from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index
because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section criteria.</font></div>
<div>When calculating index weights, individual components shares
held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded regardless of whether they are index components. In countries
with regulated environments, where a foreign investment limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect either the foreign investment limit or the percentage float, whichever is the more restrictive.</div>
<div>Each issuer’s financial statements will be used to
update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (“IWF”) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float factor used to
calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (<font>i.e.</font>, privatization, merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a float
adjustment will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.</div>
<div>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by
corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday
near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release posted on <font>www.us.spindices.com.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The
S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates. <font>SPDJI uses the
World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time for the following funds: iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares
Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF and iShares
Latin America 40 ETF. Prior to January 31, 2013, SPDJI used the currency exchange (FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m. Eastern time (with the exception of iShares Asia 50 ETF). In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific
markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day), the previous business day’s rates are normally used. SPDJI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. SPDJI may under exceptional circumstances
elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if SPDJI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency on a particular
day.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

uses Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”) and FactSet’s Revere Business Industry Classification System (“RBICS”) classifications, along with Trucost Power Generation Data for Utility companies to determine
the eligible universe. In addition, the index provider uses company exclusion criteria related to business activity (<font>e.g.</font>, controversial weapons, tobacco, thermal coal, etc.) and other exclusionary guidelines
based on a company’s compliance with the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) provided by Sustainalytics. Lastly, the index provider uses RepRisk, a leading provider of business intelligence on environmental, social, and
governance risks, for daily filtering, screening and analysis of controversies related to companies within the index. After the index provider determines the eligible universe, the index provider selects the index constituents as follows:</div>
<div>1. The index provider defines clean energy
exposure scores (“exposure scores”) for each company based on its primary business. Companies determined by the index provider to have maximum clean energy exposure are assigned a score of 1. Companies determined by the index provider to
have significant clean energy exposure are assigned a score of 0.75, and companies determined by the index provider to have moderate clean energy exposure are assigned a score of 0.5.</div>
<div>2. The index provider next calculates a
carbon-to-revenue footprint standard score by subtracting the mean carbon-to-revenue footprint of all preliminary universe stocks (before applying the exclusion criteria described above) with an exposure score of 1 as of the rebalancing reference
date from each stock’s carbon-to-revenue footprint and then dividing the difference by the standard deviation (also determined based on preliminary universe stocks with an exposure score of 1). The top and bottom five percent (5%) are excluded
from the mean and standard deviation calculations. The index provider excludes any companies with a carbon-to-revenue footprint standard score of greater than three.</div>
<div>3. All remaining exposure score 1 stocks
are selected, with a target constituent count of 100. If more than 100 exposure score 1 stocks are eligible, all exposure score 1 stocks are selected.</div>
<div>4. If fewer than 100 exposure score 1
stocks are eligible, stocks are ranked by the index provider based on float-adjusted market capitalization, and the highest-ranking stock with an exposure score of 0.75 is selected and added to the index. This process continues iteratively until the
target constituent count is reached.</div>
<div>5. If, after step 3 there are still not 100
constituents, the highest-ranking stock with an exposure score of 0.5 is selected until the target constituent count of 100 is reached, or all eligible companies with exposure scores of 1, 0.75, and 0.5 are selected.</div>
<div>If after these steps the index’s
weighted average exposure score falls below 0.85, the lowest-ranking stock with an exposure score of 0.5 is removed until the index’s weighted average exposure score reaches 0.85. If the index’s weighted average exposure score remains
below 0.85, the lowest-ranking stock with an exposure score of 0.75 is removed until the Underlying Index’s weighted average exposure score reaches 0.85. Therefore, while the Underlying Index targets a constituent count of 100 securities, it
is possible for the final index constituent count to be above or below 100 securities. Constituents are weighted based on the product of each constituent’s float-adjusted market capitalization and exposure score, with the weights of
constituents capped at the lower of either a single constituent weight cap by exposure score (8% for an exposure score of 1, 6% for an exposure score of 0.75 and 4% for an exposure score of 0.5), or five times its liquidity weight. The index
provider determines the liquidity weight of a security as follows: index weight assigned to a security based on the relative six-month median daily value traded of the security compared to that measure for the overall index. In addition, the
cumulative weight of all stocks within the index which have a weight greater than 4.5% cannot exceed 40%.</div>

<div>Investment Policies</div>
<div>The Board has adopted as fundamental policies the following
numbered investment policies, which cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in
the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of
outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.
Therefore, each Fund may change its investment objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder approval.</div>

<div>Notations Regarding the iShares International Dividend Growth
ETF’s Fundamental Investment Policies</div> <div>The
following notations are not considered to be part of the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF's fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF's industry classifications,
the Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy</div> </div>
<div type="Block"> <div>54</div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <a name="xx_88333205-ea61-467d-9d8b-b31ebae3adaf_55"> </a>
<div> <a href="#job_trust_ae78e231-6296-4ba2-98b2-babfde269aaf_sai_toc"> Table of Contents
</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>also will be interpreted
to give broad authority to the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the
Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The iShares International Dividend Growth ETF’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company
Act requires the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of the iShares International Dividend
Growth ETF's total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading
practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when
the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to
the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to permit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to engage in trading
practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit the Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in
accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and
investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of
diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of the iShares International Dividend Growth
ETF's underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the Fund’s investments in issuers where the Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions
involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause the iShares
International Dividend Growth ETF to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities,
regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than
one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures
transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>
<div>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>iShares International Dividend Growth ETF</div>
<div>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make
short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by the Fund’s Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</div>
<div>All Funds Other Than the iShares International Dividend Growth
ETF</div> <div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not
to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently limits each Fund's holdings in illiquid
investments to 15% of a Fund's net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments pursuant to the Liquidity Program.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>If any
percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain
percentage limitations will be observed continuously in accordance with applicable law.</div>
<div>All Funds</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in
accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary
receipts representing component securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the
80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance
on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of
Section 12(d)(1).</div> <div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
limitations under each Fund’s fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund’s assets invested in certain securities or other
instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue
market or tax consequences.</div> <div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to
review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the
Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its
finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to
exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Compliance Officer (and
his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s
internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees
have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a
guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</div>
<div>Committees of the Board of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board (i) in
its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's financial statements and the independent audit
thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the
independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; and (vi) to assume

to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy for a position of

current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of compensation for the Independent Trustees for
their services as Trustees, members or chairpersons of committees of the Board, Board Chair and any other positions as the Nominating and Governance Committee considers appropriate. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not consider Board
nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>activities and business
operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors
in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and other relationships with, or interests in,
companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or
advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities,
currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock
is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund
invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that
may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Funds.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund,
particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other
information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market
impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock
may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might
otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts may
also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short by
(and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with
respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock
or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The results
of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It
is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund
will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock
designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing
services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other
markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may
have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In
addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a
Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by
BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in
the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of
such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for
clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority interest will create, write or issue options which
may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to
the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices
Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual
property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock
will not receive any such payments on those derivative products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could
contribute to the viability or success of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may cause business units or
entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</div>
<div>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act
as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment
fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and
other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a
broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and
other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their
shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in
other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties based
on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the
credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate <font>pro rata </font>allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate <font>pro rata</font> allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font> indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending
opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary
due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund
may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not
required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that
furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the
investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and
securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used
in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such
products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other
services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price
discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</div>
<div>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use
the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock
receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to pay for the execution, clearing, and
settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other
services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in the above described arrangements to
varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the
commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div>
<div>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks
(“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain types of securities. These ECNs
may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and markups/markdowns, would
generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the</div> </div>

circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of,
Members Exchange (“MEMX”), a newly created U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of
such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may in the future be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock,
provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section
of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible that, from time to
time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity,
investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation
Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock itself or a BlackRock
advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements
for the Fund.</div> <div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in
securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is
compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of
BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may engage in transactions with companies in
which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers
may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability
relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their
shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to
BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a
Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a
potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients
with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such
valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants,
there may be instances where the Fund's pricing</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>vendors or fund
accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by
BlackRock’s Valuation Committee (the “Valuation Committee”) in accordance with policies and procedures approved by a Fund’s Board (the “Valuation Procedures”). When determining a “fair value price,”
the Valuation Committee seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund
might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the
time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value
of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a
Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued by the Valuation Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may
affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div>
<div>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest
all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of
expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy
and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be
taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from,
or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common
officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund
to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory
requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those
considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock
is performing advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling
securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a
creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with
BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an advisory or risk
management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The
investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies
that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the
aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause
BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either
through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business
transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights
(including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other
consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license
for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep
uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall
relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated</div> </div>

the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could result
in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain
trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and
funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to
BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in
connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>

manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,

a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than it would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or
account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an
incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees.
Although BFA and each of its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and
accounts managed by an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict of interest, which may result in the Portfolio Managers
favoring those portfolios or accounts with performance-based fee arrangements.</div>

discussion below describes the Portfolio Managers' compensation as of March 31, 2021.</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio
managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year based on a number of
factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on
their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive compensation, determined based on several components, including: the
performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the team relative to the portfolios’ investment objectives (which in
the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in
cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award
to aid in retention, align interests with long-term shareholders and motivate performance.</div>

Distributor's principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Shares are continuously offered for sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and below
in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may
be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it
receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement effective
through December 31, 2021: (i) domestic equity funds, such as the iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF and iShares Global Tech ETF (“Domestic Equity Funds”) retain 77% of securities lending income (which excludes
collateral investment fees), and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement,
effective January 1, 2022: (i) the Domestic Equity Funds retain 81% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral
investment fees.</div> <div>Pursuant to the current Securities
Lending Agency Agreement: (i) international equity funds, such as all Funds other than the iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF and iShares Global Tech ETF (“International Equity Funds”), retain 82% of securities
lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees), and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day following the date
that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable Fund, pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement, will receive for the remainder of that calendar year
securities lending income as follows:</div> <div>Domestic Equity
Funds</div> <div>(i) 81% of securities lending income (which
excludes collateral investment fees); and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>

<div>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes
collateral investment fees); and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>

<div>For the fiscal period from April 1, 2021
through April 30, 2021, the Fund had $393,105 in gross income from securities lending activities; $67,603 in securities lending income paid to BTC for services as securities lending agent; $17,086 in cash collateral management expenses not included
in securities lending income paid to BTC; $0 in administrative fees not included in securities lending income paid to BTC; $0 in indemnification fees not included in securities lending income paid to BTC; $448 in rebates (paid to borrowers); $0 in
other fees not included in securities lending income paid to BTC; $85,137 in aggregate fees/compensation for securities lending activities; and $307,968 in net income from securities lending activities. Effective April 30, 2021, the Fund changed its
fiscal year end from March 31 to April 30.</div> <div>Payments by BFA
and its Affiliates.<font>  BFA and/or its affiliates (“BFA Entities”) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries
(“Intermediaries”) for certain activities related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion
of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost
of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual
investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the
development of technology platforms and reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds
or exchange-traded products (“Publishing Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products
that feature iShares or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or</font></div> </div>

consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes
referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</div> <div>Payments to an
Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may
make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest
between the Intermediary and its clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial
incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types
of the contractual payments described above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and
Associates, LLC, Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., L.P., Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., FDx Advisors, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC,
Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions
to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other
intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may
include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in
general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives
his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive
programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the
secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive
program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate
in such programs.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset
Value</div> <div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE (currently 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as
follows:</font></div> <div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities
exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an
Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If
an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which
a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset
(as defined below).</font></div> <div>Fixed-Income Investments. <font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available
bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services
may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, recent
representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality, coupon,
maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but
a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days or less
remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each
tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the option, in
which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which
are traded on exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in
accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Funds. <font>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing
price.</font></div> <div>General Valuation Information. <font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund
values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such
determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div>
<div>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular
portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing
service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s
ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a
Fund’s books at their fair value.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Fund’s Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at
fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or the Valuation Committee (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
prevailing market rates.</div> <div>Use of fair value prices and
certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s performance and
the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in
accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete
lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a
recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a
significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred after the close of trading
for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of,
a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of
any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div>
<div>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies
evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets
in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</div>
<div>BFA, with input from portfolio management, will submit its
recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent
periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BFA, to regularly evaluate the values assigned to the securities and other assets and
liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>When
determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the Valuation Committee will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date
on which the asset or liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value
determinations will be based upon all available factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the investment may be initially priced based on the
original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable
instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an investment.</div>
<div>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not,
in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at
NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements.</div> <div>Generally, ASC 820 and other
accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities,
to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their
liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value. The SEC recently adopted new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which will establish an updated regulatory framework for registered investment company
valuation practices and may impact a Fund’s valuation policies. A Fund will not be required to comply with the new rule until September 8, 2022.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s</div> </div> <div type="Block">

apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other
circumstances.</div> <div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act
(“Section 28(e)”) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain
conditions.</div> <div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new
issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these
types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may
not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>The
Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of
depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the
U.S., will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div>
<div>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as
corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these
dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will generally include a “spread,” which is the
difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi)</div> </div> <div type="Block">

liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover,
investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to
produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or
benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which
the Funds may invest.</div> <div>IPOs of securities may be
over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be
combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or
about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest
for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the
1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds
will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as
within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses. The iShares India 50 ETF may also incur interest expenses arising from borrowings related to the acquisition of portfolio securities.</div>

redemption transactions, to the extent consisting of cash, may require the Funds to contemporaneously transact with broker-dealers for purchases of Deposit Securities (as defined below under <font>Fund Deposit</font>) or
sales of Fund Securities (as defined below under <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font>), as applicable. Such transactions with a particular broker-dealer may be conditioned upon the broker-dealer's agreement to
transact at guaranteed price levels in order to reduce transaction costs the Funds would otherwise incur as a consequence of settling creation or redemption baskets in cash rather than in-kind.</div>
<div>Following the Funds' receipt of an order to purchase or redeem
creation or redemption baskets, to the extent such purchases or redemptions consist of a cash portion, the Funds will enter an order with a broker or dealer to purchase or sell the Deposit Securities or Fund Securities, as applicable. The terms of
such order may, depending on the timing of the transaction and certain other factors, require the broker or dealer to guarantee that the Funds will achieve execution of their order at a price at least as favorable to the Funds as the Funds'
valuation of the Deposit Securities/Fund Securities used for purposes of calculating the NAV applied to the creation or redemption transactions giving rise to the orders (the “Execution Performance Guarantee”). Such orders may be placed
with the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant (or a broker-dealer affiliated with the Authorized Participant or a third-party broker-dealer engaged through the Authorized Participant) in its capacity as a broker-dealer. The amount payable
to the Funds in respect of any Execution Performance Guarantee will depend on the results achieved by the executing firm and will vary depending on market activity, timing and a variety of other factors. The Execution Performance Guarantee will
apply for any orders executed by the Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), even if the trades have not settled before the redemption transaction settles.</div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored on orders arising from creation transactions executed by an Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized Participant is required to deposit an amount with the Funds (the “Execution Performance
Deposit”). If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price more favorable than the Funds' valuation of the Deposit Securities, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the benefit of
the favorable executions, and the Fund will return to the Authorized Participant the Execution Performance Deposit. If, however, the broker-dealer executing the order is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal
to the Funds' valuation of the securities, the Funds retain the portion of the Execution Performance Deposit equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage commissions or other costs) and may require the
Authorized Participant to deposit any additional amount required to cover the full amount of the actual Execution Performance Guarantee.</div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored for brokerage orders arising from redemption transactions executed by an Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an Authorized Participant agrees to pay the shortfall amount (the
“Execution Performance Offset”). If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price more favorable than the Funds' valuation of the Fund Securities, then the Authorized Participant generally
may retain the benefit of the favorable executions and the Authorized Participant is not called upon to honor the Execution Performance Offset. If, however, the broker-dealer is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least
equal to the Funds' valuation of the securities, the Funds will be entitled to the portion of the Execution Performance Offset equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage commissions or other costs).</div>
<div>The circumstances under which the Execution Performance
Guarantee will be used and the expected amount, if any, of any Execution Performance Deposit or Execution Performance Offset for the Funds will be disclosed in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time

the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through
subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain</div> </div>

to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may
decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust
shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit
size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div> <div>Any
Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>

<div>The approximate value per creation unit
for the iShares Global Tech ETF is as of July 19, 2021.</div>
<div>In its discretion, the Trust reserves the right to increase or
decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a corresponding change in the number of
shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day the Fund is open for business, including any day when it satisfies redemption requests as required by Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for business any day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is
open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div> <div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of each Fund (except for the iShares India 50 ETF, which is generally offered in Creation Units solely for cash) generally consists of Deposit Securities and the
Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with a Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a
collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as
described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing a Creation Unit.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div><br/> The
iShares India 50 ETF’s current policy is to accept cash in substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. The Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit
Securities (<font>i.e</font>., the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If the Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a
purchaser’s delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the Cash Component will constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which will represent the consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. All other Funds discussed in this SAI
generally offer Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash. Please see the <font>Cash Purchase Method</font> section below and the following discussion
summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities
change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit
Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash
Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit through “systematic rounding.” The rounding methodology “rounds up” position sizes of securities in the Deposit Securities (which in
turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</div>
<div>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards
a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments are not
eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able to be traded due to a trading
restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; (v) in connection
with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (Creation
Units of the iShares India 50 ETF are generally offered solely for cash, while Creation Units of all other Funds in this SAI are generally offered partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases
thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required
to be paid by an in-kind purchaser. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash purchases, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain
brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and
redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows
such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units (an “Authorized Participant”). Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and
on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>NAV of a Creation Unit is
next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such
Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their
particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result,
purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of
current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These
guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the
Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To
initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to
receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the
Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an
Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper
submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a
weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or
its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the
facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Once a Fund
has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance
to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div>
<div>Each Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a
creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the
Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit
would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the
Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of
its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur
any liability for failure to give such notification.</div> <div>In
addition, the iShares India 50 ETF may exercise its right to reject any creation order for shares of the Fund on any Business Day that is a holiday in the Indian market, but not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market, and certain other
holidays during the settlement cycle for Fund shares, in order to protect Fund shareholders from any dilutive costs that may be associated with the purchase of Deposit Securities in connection with creation orders on such days.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2,
including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 in order to
accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized
Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. Information
concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time
and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other
charges.</div> <div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may
create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption
transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined
by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer, processing and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged on
each Creation Unit created by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard creation transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table below regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, but
may be reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the creation are</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

creation transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with
creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</div>

<div>Redemption of Creation Units.
<font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on
a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the
secondary market.</font></div> <div>The iShares India 50 ETF
generally redeems Creation Units solely for cash. However, the Fund reserves the right to distribute securities in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally redeem Creation Units partially for

(“Fund Securities” or “Redemption Basket”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below) (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of
Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations
of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund,
the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption
request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would
be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized Participant
due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or otherwise
delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event that the Fund
Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The iShares India 50 ETF generally redeems
Creation Units generally for cash. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs
from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through
systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be “rounded up,” while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in
the Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the iShares India 50 ETF are generally redeemed solely for cash, while Creation Units of all other Funds in this SAI are
generally redeemed partially for cash or where the market for individual securities does not permit in-kind redemption), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash
redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The Authorized
Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash redemptions, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and
price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Cash redemption proceeds will be paid to the Authorized
Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption or within seven calendar days thereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a cash basis and an Authorized Participant has entered into an Execution Performance
Guarantee, but the Authorized Participant is unable, as determined by BFA in its sole discretion, to execute the market transactions that are the subject of the Execution Performance Guarantee due to an extended market holiday that goes over seven
calendar days or in certain other situations where all or a portion of the transactions are unable to be executed within seven calendar days, then the Fund may pay the full amount of the redemption order (or the remaining amount of the redemption
order based on the unexecuted portion of the transaction) within the original seven calendar day period by using the Fund’s overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand. The Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated
broker-dealer), acting on an agency basis, will subsequently enter into one or more separate market transactions when the markets reopen or the trades are otherwise able to be executed through which a Fund sells the Fund securities (or the remaining
unsold Fund Securities) subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves executions in market transactions at a price more favorable than a Fund’s valuation of the
Fund Securities as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. Specifically, if the</div> </div>

<div>In addition, if transacting as broker with a Fund in a
non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized Participant may be required to cover foreign exchange costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the Brokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If the foreign exchange transaction
associated with the applicable security trades can only occur upon the settlement of a security trade and such trades are unable, as determined by BFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by the seventh calendar day after receipt of the Authorized
Participant's redemption order, then a Fund may pay within the original seven calendar day period the amount due in respect of the redemption order based on the foreign exchange rate as of the date of the redemption order by using the Fund’s
overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand and subsequently enter into one or more separate foreign exchange transactions with the Authorized Participant (or a broker-dealer affiliate of the Authorized Participant or a third-party
broker-dealer engaged through the Authorized Participant), acting on an agency basis, and be subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the Authorized Participant achieves execution of the foreign exchange transactions at a price or more favorable than
the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. If the Authorized Participant is unable to achieve execution of the
foreign exchange transactions at a price at least equal to the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant is required to make the applicable shortfall payment to the
Fund.</div> <div>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer, processing and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged on each
Creation Unit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard redemption transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table below regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, but may
be reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the redemption are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a redemption consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an
additional transaction charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the redemption transaction. Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund
to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a
fee for such services.</font></div> <div>The following table sets

<div>If a redemption consists of a cash portion and each Fund
places a brokerage transaction to sell portfolio securities with the Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the Authorized Participant may be required, in its capacity as broker-dealer with respect to that
transaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the <font>Brokerage Transactions</font> section of this
SAI.</div> <div>Placement of Redemption Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable request to redeem
shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier
that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized
Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The Authorized
Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular
broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant
Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should
allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div> <div>For

transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions
on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates
(<font>i.e.</font>, the last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other circumstances consistent with applicable law. </div>
<div>If neither the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible
to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such
case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and
additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal
and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or
cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions
of Creation Units (except that, as noted above, Creation Units of each Fund generally will be redeemed partially for cash, with the exception Creation Units of the iShares India 50 ETF, which generally will be redeemed for cash), in the event that
cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign
investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment
in response to a redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's
agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time
specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver
the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later
than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect
of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant
to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is
suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other
circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Baskets.<font>  Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept “custom baskets.” A custom basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a
non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or (iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a
single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the
parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the
employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures
distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an
Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</font></div>
<div>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of the Creation Units
purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation
Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a
Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income
must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or
forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at
least 90% of their income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total
assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater
than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or
businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of
its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable</div> </div>

these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal
Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may
result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will be
subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines
that doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings
and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its
assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such
assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Excise Tax.<font>  A Fund will
be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12
months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by year-end. In addition, the
minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute
dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font></div>
<div>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership
change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>
<div>The following Funds had net capital loss carryforwards, as set
forth in the table below, as of March 31, 2021, the tax year-end for the Funds:</div> <div>

distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar
year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount
equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event,
the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares
of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their
credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b).
Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or
claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions of net
realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of
capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving
cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount.</div>

net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e.</font>, the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares. <font> Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of mutual funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Withholding. <font> In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide
a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S.
person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s
basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to
market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust
also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent
permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and
losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay
dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a
RIC.</font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“Section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All Section 1256 contracts
held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value
at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and
were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund
may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</div>
<div>Qualified Dividend Income.
<font> Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend
income, which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is,
in general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, non-U.S.
corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S.

payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</div>
<div>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified
dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with
respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding
requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to
a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that
dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer
who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the extent the RIC’s income is derived from
ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a Fund of its net short-term capital
gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</div> <div>Corporate
Dividends Received Deduction.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for
corporations. A 46-day minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference
dividends) during which risk of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness,
including a short sale, is attributable to the investment.</font></div>
<div>Issues Related to India and Mauritius Taxes. <font> The following discussion does not address the effect on investors, including residents of India and citizens of India (whether or not residing in India or other countries, including the U.S.), of holding shares of
the iShares India 50 ETF. Investors should consult their own tax advisors as to these issues based upon their own personal situations.</font></div>
<div>Indian tax matters discussed herein are based on the
provisions of the IT Act, the provisions of the DTAA and other laws currently in force as of the date of this SAI. All such laws and the DTAA are subject to prospective and retroactive legislative amendment, administrative rulings and judicial
review.</div> <div>The iShares India 50 ETF invests in India
through the Subsidiary. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Subsidiary has elected to be treated as an entity disregarded from its owner. Thus, for U.S. federal tax purposes, any income or loss realized by the Subsidiary will be treated as
realized by the applicable fund. Therefore, any investment made by each Fund into the Subsidiary and any distributions received by the Fund from the Subsidiary are disregarded for U.S. federal tax purposes. Furthermore, there is no tax on each
Fund's investment in the Subsidiary or on distributions made from the Subsidiary to the Fund.</div>
<div>No investor in the iShares India 50 ETF will be subject to
taxation in India unless such investor is a resident of India or, if a non-resident, has an Indian source income or income received (whether accrued or otherwise) in India or triggers the indirect transfer provisions (discussed below). The IT Act
provides for the concept of POEM for the determination of the residency of a foreign company. Accordingly, a company would be said to be resident in India if its POEM is situated in India. POEM is defined as a place where the key management and
commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made. The taxation of the Subsidiary and the Fund in India is governed by</div> </div>

Act, read with the provisions of the DTAA. As per Section 90(2) of the IT Act, the provisions of the IT Act would apply to the extent they are more beneficial than the provisions of the DTAA. In order to claim the beneficial provisions of the DTAA,
the Subsidiary must be a tax resident of Mauritius.</div> <div>An
investor is required to submit a TRC as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary has been incorporated in Mauritius and has
obtained its TRC from the Mauritius authorities that establishes its residency in Mauritius under the DTAA. The TRC must be renewed annually. The iShares India 50 ETF expects the Subsidiary to maintain its Mauritius tax residency, but it cannot be
assured that the Mauritius authorities will successfully renew its TRC annually or that it will continue to be eligible to the DTAA benefits, particularly in light of the new requirements that may be introduced if the DTAA is re-negotiated.</div>
<div>Further, the Subsidiary will need to ensure that its
management and control is in Mauritius so as to be tax resident in Mauritius.</div>
<div>If the Subsidiary is not centrally managed and controlled in
Mauritius, it will be treated as non-resident for tax purposes.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary holds a Category 1 Global Business License
issued on September 23, 2008 and an authorisation to operate as a Collective Investment Scheme and as an Expert Fund issued on September 23, 2008 by the Financial Services Commission of Mauritius. The Subsidiary is subject to tax in Mauritius on its
net income at the rate of 15%. However, the Subsidiary is entitled to a system of foreign tax credits or partial exemption which reduces the Mauritius income tax rate. The Subsidiary is entitled to tax credits against the income tax payable in
Mauritius (<font>i.e.</font>, up to a maximum of 15%) for foreign tax suffered on foreign source income where this can be evidenced. Alternatively, the Subsidiary is entitled (i) up to 30 June 2021, to a deemed foreign tax
credit equivalent to 80% of the Mauritius tax payable, resulting in a maximum effective tax rate of 3% or (ii) to a partial exemption of 80% in respect of all its income resulting in the company being subject to tax only on the remaining 20% of the
income at the rate of 15% provided the company satisfies the conditions relating to the substance of its activities. Further, the Subsidiary is not subject to capital gains tax in Mauritius nor is it subject to tax in Mauritius on any gains from the
sale of securities. Any dividends paid by the Subsidiary to the iShares India 50 ETF will also be exempt from tax in Mauritius.</div>
<div>The DTAA gives India the right to tax capital gains that arise
from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary will attempt to abide by the requirements of
the DTAA, to maintain its residency in Mauritius, and to ensure that management and control of the Subsidiary remain in Mauritius. Any change in the applicability of the provisions of the DTAA or in its applicability to the Subsidiary could result
in the Subsidiary and indirectly the iShares India 50 ETF being subject to Indian income taxes, withholding taxes, and other taxes, as well as being subject to administrative or judicial assertion of such tax liabilities by the tax authorities of
India. This could significantly reduce the return of the Fund on its investments in shares and the return received by Fund shareholders.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary is expected to have income in the form of
capital gains, income from dividends and income from interest. The Indian tax consequences for the Subsidiary on account of the application of the DTAA, read with the provisions of the IT Act, would be as follows (the rates are inclusive of the
highest applicable surcharges):</div> <div>

gains arising from transfer of share or interest in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian
taxes.</div> <div>Under IT Act, gains realized when a non-resident
acquires shares of a foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50%
of the value the company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div>
<div>Because the Fund invests in Indian securities through the
Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the Fund may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets. Accordingly, shareholder redemptions of Fund/Subsidiary shares and sales of Fund shares may have been subject to Indian tax and
withholding obligations. However, non-resident investors, investing directly or indirectly in Category I FPI, registered under 2019 Regulations, are exempt from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation under the IT Act. The Subsidiary has
been registered as a Category I FPI under the 2019 Regulations. Therefore, any redemptions or transfers by the Fund or by shareholders in the Fund should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax.</div>
<div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules.</div>
<div>The GAAR introduced in the IT Act provides the Indian tax
authorities a mechanism to deny any tax benefits in a transaction or any other arrangement that is believed to not have any commercial substance or purpose other than to obtain tax benefit(s) under a treaty. The provisions of GAAR will be applicable
to arrangements (including a step in or a part thereof) entered into by a taxpayer, which may be declared as an “impermissible avoidance arrangement”.</div>
<div>CBDT has clarified that where a FPI (such as the Subsidiary)
is located in a particular jurisdiction based on non-tax commercial reasons and the main purpose of the choice of location/residence of the FPI is not to obtain a treaty benefit, the GAAR provisions will not be resorted to by the tax
authorities.</div> <div>As per the provisions of the IT Rules, GAAR
shall not apply in the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>

aggregate tax benefit to all the parties of the arrangement in the relevant financial year does not exceed INR 30 Million; </td></tr>

<div>If the iShares India 50 ETF's use of the Subsidiary were
considered to be such an impermissible avoidance arrangement, the Fund may become subject directly to taxation in India. The IT Act, provides that if the main purpose of any part or step of the arrangement is to obtain tax benefit, the entire
arrangement shall be presumed to have been entered into with the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit and the burden of proof will be on the taxpayer to establish that obtaining a tax benefit was not the main purpose of the entire arrangement. GAAR
may, irrespective of existing treaty provisions, lead to the imposition of tax liabilities and withholding obligations, which may lead the Fund to modify the structure.</div>
<div>Recent amendments to DTAA and GAAR could change the manner in
which the Subsidiary are currently taxed in India and could adversely impact the returns to the iShares India 50 ETF/Subsidiary and their respective shareholders. The Funds will continue to monitor developments in India with respect to these
matters. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to their own tax situations and the tax consequences of an investment in each of the Funds.</div>
<div>Excess Inclusion Income.
<font> Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) from being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt
shareholder could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types
of income received by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as “excess inclusion income.” To Fund
shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain
charitable entities; (ii) not be offset</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain “disqualified organizations,” as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is
imposed on the trust.</div> <div>A Fund tries to avoid investing in
REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT may change its investment
program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive investment opportunities.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments.
<font> Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated
in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988
gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and
certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless a
Fund was to elect otherwise.</font></div> <div>Each Fund may be
subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to “pass through” to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the security on the
dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed distribution will
(i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but
only for investors who itemize their deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes.
Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not “passed through” for tax purposes will not be available to shareholders
for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the Fund elects to “pass through” its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.
tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate
shares of non-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income.
Certain limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by
a Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under
certain circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. <font> If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed
as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC
as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information
from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to
the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that
would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of
previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could
potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from
dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible,
and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div>
<div>Reporting. <font> If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations
of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains”
(generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible
dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a
non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div>Special rules may apply to a
foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code
and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the foreign
shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income</div>

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on

account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the
IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of
U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required
information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder
information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to
investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</div>
<div>iShares Global Consumer Staples<br/> iShares Global Energy
ETF<br/> iShares India 50 ETF</div> <div>Investors’ Rights. <font> Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent. Further information about the duties and roles of these service
providers is set out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund are not parties to the relevant agreement with these service providers and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain
institutional investors that are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under
federal or state law against a Fund or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim against a Fund, or against any service provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult
its own legal advisor.</font></div> <div>By contract, Authorized
Participants irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Authorized Participant Agreement.
Jurisdiction over other claims, whether by investors or Authorized Participants, will turn on the facts of the particular case and the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought.</div> </div>

<div>The Boards of Trustees/Directors (“Directors”) of
open-end funds (the “Funds”) advised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock”), have the responsibility for the oversight of voting proxies relating to portfolio securities of the Funds, and have
determined that it is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders to delegate the responsibility to vote proxies to BlackRock, subject to the principles outlined in this Policy, as part of BlackRock’s authority to manage, acquire
and dispose of account assets, all as contemplated by the Funds’ respective investment management agreements.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted guidelines and procedures (together and
as from time to time amended, the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on
specific proxy issues in respect of securities held by each such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines.</div>
<div>BlackRock will report on an annual basis to the Directors on
(1) a summary of all proxy votes that BlackRock has made on behalf of the Funds in the preceding year together with a representation that all votes were in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines, and (2) any changes to the BlackRock

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people
experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a
full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the
world.</div> <div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”)
activities are focused on maximizing long-term value for our clients. BIS does this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached
to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests. Effective voting rights are central to the
rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be
able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital structure. In
order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long -term economic interests of our clients, and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long -term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a <font>team profile on our website</font>.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long -term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that investee companies are facing and their governance structures. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach
to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s engagements emphasize direct dialogue with
corporate leadership on the governance issues identified in these principles that have a material impact on financial performance. These engagements enable us to cast informed votes aligned with clients’ long-term economic interests. We
generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue
and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them
constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies, or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to
companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>governance (including in
relation to board structure) and why this approach is in the best interest of shareholders. We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the
company, or the performance of individual board members. We believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order for
shareholders to assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>current or former employment
at the company or a subsidiary within the past several years </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>being, or representing, a
shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>interlocking directorships
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>having
 any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non -executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with
a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing
risk.</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Capital
structure, mergers, asset sales and other special transactions</div>
<div>The capital structure of a company is critical to its owners,
the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders against the dilution of
their interests.</div> <div>Effective voting rights are central to
the rights of ownership and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting
power should match economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned
that the creation of a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote
principle is designed to mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class
structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give
unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long -term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long -term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long -term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and
social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively
gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to issue reports aligned with the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of
disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate
change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against
these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification processes in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>1)
 </td>
<td>publish a disclosure in line
with industry-specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2)
 </td>
<td>disclose
climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to
less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>See our
<font>commentary</font><font> </font>on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors.</div>
<div>In deciding our course of action, we will assess the
company’s disclosures and the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>

process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>

<td>There
 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply,</div> </div>

<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long - term financial
sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate -related risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>We expect companies to help their investors understand how the
company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with
TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and
mitigating that risk.</div> <div>Where a company receives a
shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as
revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress
on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Committee also reviews and
approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long - term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div>
<div>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in
the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item. Portfolio managers may from time to time reach differing views on how best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment.
Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from one another. However, because BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are
frequently cast in a uniform manner.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes engagements based on factors
including but not limited to our need for additional information to make a voting decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic value of the company. Within the normal course
of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management or business partnership roles, in discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general
corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met. </td></tr>
<tr>

 </td>
<td>Determined
 to engage, in certain instances, an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such
circumstances, the independent fiduciary provides BlackRock’s proxy voting agent with instructions, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies, and BlackRock’s proxy voting agent votes the proxy in accordance with
the independent fiduciary’s determination. BlackRock uses an independent fiduciary to vote proxies of (i) any company that is affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., (ii) any public company that includes BlackRock employees on its board of directors,
(iii) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., (iv) any public company of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive, and (v) companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent fiduciary. In
selecting an independent fiduciary, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and vote in the best economic interest of our clients, reputation for reliability and integrity,
and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at an independent fiduciary. The
Global Committee appoints and reviews the performance of the independent fiduciar(ies), generally on an annual basis. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending
agent on behalf of Funds. With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The decision whether to recall securities on loan to vote is based
on a formal analysis of the revenue producing value to clients of loans, against the assessed economic value of casting votes. Generally, we expect that the likely economic value to clients of casting votes would be less than the securities lending
income, either because, in our assessment, the resolutions being voted on will not have significant economic consequences or because the outcome would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to vote. BlackRock also may, in
our discretion, determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div>
<div>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining
whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may modify it as necessary.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship Global Corporate Governance Guidelines &amp; Engagement Principles (See Appendix A2 of this SAI).</div>
<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,
“BlackRock”) seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and enhance the economic value of the securities held in client accounts. The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the
“Guidelines”) are intended to summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s general philosophy and approach to corporate governance issues that most commonly arise in proxy voting for U.S. securities. These Guidelines are not
intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how BlackRock will vote in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide
insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots , as well as our expectations of boards of directors. They are applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the
company and the individual ballot item.</div> <div>VOTING
GUIDELINES</div> <div>These guidelines are divided into eight key
themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders:</div> <div>

DIRECTORS</div> <div>Director elections</div>
<div>In general, BlackRock supports the election of directors as
recommended by the board in uncontested elections. However, we believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held account able. We may withhold votes from directors or members of particular board
committees in certain situations, as indicated below .</div>
<div>Independence</div>
<div>We expect a majority of the directors on the board to be
independent. In addition, all members of key committees, including audit, compensation, and nominating / governance committees, should be independent. Our view of independence may vary slightly from listing standards.</div>
<div>In particular, common impediments to independence in the U.S.
may include:</div> <div>

<td>Employment as a senior
executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•

<td>An equity ownership in the
company in excess of 20% </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Having
 any other interest, business, or relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We may vote against directors serving on key committees that
we do not consider to be independent.</div> <div>When evaluating
controlled companies, as defined by the U.S. stock exchanges, we will only vote against insiders or affiliates who sit on the audit committee, but not other key committees.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>We expect the board to exercise appropriate oversight over
management and business activities of the company. We will consider voting against committee members and / or individual directors in the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where the
board has failed to exercise oversight with regard to accounting practices or audit oversight, we will consider voting against the current audit committee, and any other members of the board who may be responsible. For example, this may apply to
members of the audit committee during a period when the board failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing if substantial accounting irregularities suggest insufficient oversight by that committee </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Members
of the compensation committee during a period in which executive compensation appears excessive relative to performance and peers, and where we believe the compensation committee has not already substantially addressed this issue </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The chair
of the nominating / governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating / governance committee member with the longest tenure, where the board is not comprised of a majority of independent directors. However, this would not apply in the
case of a controlled company </td></tr>

 </td>
<td>Where it

<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where a
director has a pattern of poor attendance at combined board and applicable key committee meetings. Excluding exigent circumstances, BlackRock generally considers attendance at less than 75% of the combined board and applicable key committee meetings
by a board member to be poor attendance </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•

 a director serves on an excess number of boards, which may limit his / her capacity to focus on each board’s requirements. The following illustrates the maximum number of boards on which a director may serve, before he / she is considered to

<div>Board composition and effectiveness</div>
<div>We encourage boards to periodically renew their membership to
ensure relevant skills and experience within the boardroom. To this end, regular performance reviews and skills assessments should be conducted by the nominating / governance committee.</div>
<div>Furthermore, we expect boards to be comprised of a diverse
selection of individuals who bring their personal and professional experiences to bear in order to create a constructive debate of competing views and opinions in the boardroom. We recognize that diversity has multiple dimensions. In identifying
potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the full breadth of diversity including personal factors, such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of
expertise, and geographic location. In addition to other elements of diversity, we encourage companies to have at least two women directors on their board. Our publicly available <font>commentary</font><sup> </sup>explains our approach to engaging on board diversity.</div>

<div>While we support regular board refreshment, we are not opposed
in principle to long-tenured directors, nor do we believe that long board tenure is necessarily an impediment to director independence. A variety of director tenures within the boardroom can be beneficial to ensure board quality and continuity of
experience.</div> <div>Our primary concern is that board members
are able to contribute effectively as corporate strategy evolves and business conditions change, and that all directors, regardless of tenure, demonstrate appropriate responsiveness to shareholders. We acknowledge that no single person can be
expected to bring all relevant skill sets to a board; at the same time, we generally do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to have any particular director on the board solely by virtue of a singular background or specific area of
expertise.</div> <div>Where boards find that age limits or term
limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits.</div>
<div>To the extent that we believe that a company has not
adequately accounted for diversity in its board composition within a reasonable timeframe, we may vote against the nominating / governance committee for an apparent lack of commitment to board effectiveness.</div> </div>

size</div> <div>We typically defer to the board in setting the
appropriate size and believe directors are generally in the best position to assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for effective shareholder representation or too large to
function efficiently.</div> <div>CEO and management succession
planning</div> <div>There should be a robust CEO and senior
management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. We expect succession planning to cover both long-term planning consistent with the strategic direction of the company and identified leadership
needs over time, as well as short-term planning in the event of an unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain its executive succession planning process, including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this
task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information commonly associated with this exercise.</div>
<div>Classified board of directors / staggered terms</div>
<div>We believe that directors should be re-elected annually and
that classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we may make
exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure, such as when a company needs consistency and stability during a time of transition, e.g. newly public companies or companies undergoing a
strategic restructuring. A classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating companies in certain circumstances. We would, however, expect boards with a classified structure to periodically review the rationale for such structure and
consider when annual elections might be appropriate.</div>
<div>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns of
a specific director, we may choose to vote against or withhold votes from the available slate of directors by default (see “Shareholder rights” for additional detail).</div>
<div>Contested director elections</div>
<div>The details of contested elections, or proxy contests, are
assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, which may include: the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the
dissident’s and management’s plans; the likelihood that the dissident’s solutions will produce the desired change; and whether the dissident represents the best option for enhancing long -term shareholder value.</div>
<div>Cumulative voting</div>
<div>We believe that a majority vote standard is in the best long
-term interest of shareholders. It ensures director accountability via the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may
disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or director candidates.</div>
<div>Director compensation and equity programs</div>
<div>We believe that compensation for directors should be
structured to attract and retain the best possible directors, while also aligning their interests with those of shareholders. We believe director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value creation and include some
form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal. In addition, we expect directors to build meaningful share ownership over time.</div>
<div>Majority vote requirements</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should generally be elected
by a majority of the shares voted and will normally support proposals seeking to introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by
shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. Some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where we believe that
the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

oversight</div> <div>Companies should have an established process
for identifying, monitoring, and managing key risks. Independent directors should have ready access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure they can properly oversee risk management. We encourage companies to
provide transparency around risk measurement, mitigation, and reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to changes in corporate strategy and / or shifts in the business
and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long -term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust
disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>Separation of chairman and CEO</div>
<div>We believe that independent leadership is important in the
boardroom. In the U.S. there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership: 1) an independent chairman; or 2) a lead independent director when the roles of chairman and CEO are combined.</div>
<div>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer
to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</div>
<div>In the event that the board chooses a combined chair / CEO
model, we generally support the designation of a lead independent director if they have the power to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent
directors. Furthermore, while we anticipate that most directors will be elected annually, we believe an element of continuity is important for this role for an extended period of time to provide appropriate leadership balance to the chair /
CEO.</div> <div>The following table illustrates examples of
responsibilities under each board leadership model:</div> <div>

<div>AUDITORS AND AUDIT-RELATED ISSUES</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial
statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board responsible for overseeing the
management of the audit function at a company, and may withhold votes from the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We look to</div> </div>

for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take particular note of cases involving
significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we expect timely disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a significant financial restatement, or the audit firm
has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders, we may also vote against ratification.</div>
<div>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to
promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</div>
<div>CAPITAL STRUCTURE PROPOSALS</div>
<div>Equal voting rights</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders should be entitled to
voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. We believe that companies that look to add or already have dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.
Companies should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure
or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Equal voting rights</div>

<div>Blank check preferred stock</div>
<div>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a
class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights (“blank check” preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from shareholders to the board and as a possible
entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to
management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</div>
<div>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the
company:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Appears to have a legitimate
financing motive for requesting blank check authority </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has committed publicly that
blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has a history of using blank
check preferred stock for financings </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has
 blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Increase in authorized common shares</div>
<div>BlackRock considers industry-specific norms in our analysis of
these proposals, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares. Generally, we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firm’s
business. The most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is not in the economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</div>
<div>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred
stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Stock
splits</div> <div>We generally support stock splits that are not
likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where the reverse split will not have a
negative impact on share value (e.g<font>.</font> one class is reduced while others remain at pre- split levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the
company’s authorized stock, we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</div>
<div>MERGERS, ASSET SALES, AND OTHER SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS</div>
<div>BlackRock’s primary concern is the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders. While merger, asset sales, and other special transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such as:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger announcement. In most cases, business combinations should
provide a premium. We may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments. For companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There should be clear
strategic, operational, and / or financial rationale for the combination </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Unanimous
board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider whether
executive and / or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>We
 prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Poison pill plans</div>
<div>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by
management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although we oppose most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable “qualifying offer clause.” Such clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill
and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed.</div>
<div>These clauses also tend to specify that an all cash bid for
all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote, or the board to seek the written consent of shareholders where
shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual
shareholders.</div> <div>We generally vote in favor of shareholder
proposals to rescind poison pills.</div> <div>Reimbursement of
expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</div> <div>We
generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign. We believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize
disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</div>
<div>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</div>
<div>We note that there are both management and shareholder
proposals related to executive compensation. We generally vote on these proposals as described below, except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is
sufficient to address the issue. We may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the company’s history suggests that the issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Advisory
resolutions on executive compensation (“Say on Pay”)</div>
<div>In cases where there is a Say on Pay vote, BlackRock will
respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to shareholders. In a commentary on our website, entitled “<font>BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation</font>,” we explain our beliefs and expectations related to executive compensation practices, our Say on Pay analysis framework,
and our typical approach to engagement and voting on Say on Pay.</div>
<div>Advisory votes on the frequency of Say on Pay resolutions</div>
<div>BlackRock will generally support triennial pay frequency
votes, but we defer to the board to determine the appropriate timeframe upon which pay should be reviewed. In evaluating pay, we believe that the compensation committee is responsible for constructing a plan that appropriately incentivizes
executives for long-term value creation, utilizing relevant metrics and structure to ensure overall pay and performance alignment. In a similar vein, we defer to the board to establish the most appropriate timeframe for review of pay structure,
absent a change in strategy that would suggest otherwise.</div>
<div>However, we may support an annual pay frequency vote in some
situations, for example, where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance. In these circumstances, we will also consider voting against the compensation committee members.</div>
<div>Claw back proposals</div>
<div>We generally favor recoupment from any senior executive whose
compensation was based on faulty financial reporting or deceptive business practices. In addition to fraudulent acts, we also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior caused direct financial harm to shareholders, reputational risk
to the company , or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for
directly by the company. We typically support shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns.</div>
<div>Employee stock purchase plans</div>
<div>We believe these plans can provide performance incentives and
help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common form of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically
support qualified ESPP proposals.</div> <div>Equity compensation
plans</div> <div>BlackRock supports equity plans that align the
economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of shareholders. We believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder
interests (e.g. the use of stock as collateral for a loan; the use of stock in a margin account; the use of stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative transactions). We may support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such
policies.</div> <div>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is
based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain “evergreen” provisions, which allow for
the unlimited increase of shares reserved without requiring further shareholder approval after a reasonable time period. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may also oppose plans that provide for
the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee before
acceleration or special payments are triggered.</div> <div>Golden
parachutes</div> <div>We generally view golden parachutes as
encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to shareholders. However, a large potential pay-out under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a management team to support a sub-optimal
sale price for a company. When determining whether to support or oppose an</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>advisory vote on a golden
parachute plan, we normally support the plan unless it appears to result in payments that are excessive or detrimental to shareholders. In evaluating golden parachute plans, BlackRock may consider several factors, including:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether we believe that the
triggering event is in the best interest of shareholders </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether management attempted
to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether excessively large
excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light of performance and peers </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
 the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to effectively manage the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan until
after it has been triggered; as a result, BlackRock may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved by shareholders when it was implemented.</div>
<div>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that
implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval. We generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed 2.99 times an executive’s current salary and bonus, including equity compensation.</div>
<div>Option exchanges</div>
<div>We believe that there may be legitimate instances where
underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case -by-case basis. BlackRock may support a request to reprice or exchange
underwater options under the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual company performance </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Directors
and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully contemplated </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is clear evidence that absent repricing, the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock may also support a request to exchange underwater
options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in the best interest of shareholders.</div>
<div>Pay-for-Performance plans</div>
<div>In order for executive compensation exceeding $1 million USD
to qualify for federal tax deductions, related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) requires companies to link compensation for the company’s top five executives to
disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval. The law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside directors administer these plans. Because the primary objective of these proposals is to
preserve the deductibility of such compensation, we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income.</div>
<div>Supplemental executive retirement plans</div>
<div>BlackRock may support shareholder proposals requesting to put
extraordinary benefits contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under
employee-wide plans.</div> <div>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL

to issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as
complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the
business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk
assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>

<div>See our
<font>commentary</font> on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will
assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>

 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social, ethical, or
political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect the ir long-term economic interests as shareholders. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>We expect
companies to help their investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this
issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business
and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to
climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our
engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related
disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities</div>
<div>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within
legal and regulatory limits, in order to influence public policy consistent with the companies’ values and strategies, and thus serve shareholders’ best long-term economic interests. These activities can create risks, including: the
potential for allegations of corruption; the potential for reputational issues associated with a candidate, party, or issue; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory , and compliance considerations associated with corporate political
activity. We believe that companies which choose to engage in political activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and to mitigate risks, including a level of board oversight.</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder proposals requesting increased
disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view regarding the associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards
and management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may decide to support a shareholder proposal requesting
additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or actual harm to shareholders’ interests, and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with
sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk.</div>
<div>Finally, we believe that it is not the role of shareholders to
suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div>
<div>GENERAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS</div>
<div>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</div>
<div>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains
items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best long-term economic interests.</div>
<div>Bundled proposals</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the opportunity to
review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BlackRock may reject certain positive changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict
or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Exclusive forum provisions</div>
<div>BlackRock generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum
for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote against the independent chair or lead independent director and
members of the governance committee.</div> <div>Multi-jurisdictional
companies</div> <div>Where a company is listed on multiple
exchanges or incorporated in a country different from its primary listing, we will seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific proposals</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>on the shareholder meeting
agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs itself, and the market context of each specific proposal on the agenda. If the relevant
standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. We expect that companies will disclose the rationale for their
selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, in particular where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</div>
<div>Other business</div>
<div>We oppose giving companies our proxy to vote on matters where
we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</div>
<div>Reincorporation</div>
<div>Proposals to reincorporate from one state or country to
another are most frequently motivated by considerations of anti - takeover protections, legal advantages, and / or cost savings. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to
reincorporate. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charter / articles / bylaws to assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections
are diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</div>
<div>IPO governance</div>
<div>We expect boards to consider and disclose how the corporate
governance structures adopted upon initial public offering (“IPO”) are in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also expect boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and control structures, such that boards
might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our <font>letter on unequal voting structures</font>, we articulate
our view that “one vote for one share” is the preferred structure for publicly -traded companies. We also recognize the potential benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, we believe
that these structures should have a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we believe that such arrangements may not be in the
best interest of shareholders in the long-term.</div> <div>We will
typically apply a one-year grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, director independence and over-boarding considerations), during which we expect boards to take steps to bring
corporate governance standards in line with our expectations.</div>
<div>Further, if a company qualifies as an emerging growth company
(an “EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted under the JOBS Act for the duration such a company is
categorized as an EGC. We expect an EGC to have a totally independent audit committee by the first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and audit -related issues applicable in full for an EGC on the first
anniversary of its IPO.</div> <div>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS</div>
<div>Amendment to charter / articles / bylaws</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the right to vote on
key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms and amendments to the charter / articles / bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a
reasonable period of time, in particular if those changes have the potential to impact shareholder rights ( see “Director elections” herein). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes to the charter / articles /
bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance structure.</div>
<div>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make
changes to the charter / articles / bylaws, we will consider in part the company’s and / or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes, the company’s governance profile and history, relevant jurisdictional laws, and
situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed</div> </div> <div type="Block">

factors. We will typically support changes to the charter / articles / bylaws where the benefits to shareholders, including the costs of failing to make those changes, demonstrably outweigh the costs or risks of making such changes.</div>
<div>Proxy access</div>
<div>We believe that long-term shareholders should have the
opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</div>
<div>In our view, securing the right of shareholders to nominate
directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, stimulate board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of
directing that attention where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that
the mechanism will not be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking to take control of the board.</div>
<div>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access
proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a
standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</div>
<div>Right to act by written consent</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad
support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to solicit votes by written consent
provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of
outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent. We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion
of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder
proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that we believe offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without
having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</div> <div>Right
to call a special meeting</div> <div>In exceptional circumstances
and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to call
a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of 15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called, in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in
addressing narrowly supported interests. However, we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others. We generally believe that a right to act via written consent
is not a sufficient alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</div>
<div>Simple majority voting</div>
<div>We generally favor a simple majority voting requirement to
pass proposals. Therefore, we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect their economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations
where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may support supermajority requirements in those situations.</div> </div>
