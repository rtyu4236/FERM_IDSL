While the Fund historically carried out its investment strategies by investing all of its assets invested in India through the Subsidiary, it will be eliminating its use of the Subsidiary and will invest in Indian securities directly. The Fund incurred transaction costs from the Transfer. </div></div><div>Pursuant to the Transfer, the following changes are made to the Fund’s Prospectus, Summary Prospectus and SAI. </div><div><div>All references to the Subsidiary are deleted. </div></div><div><div><div><div>Change in the Fund’s “Principal Investment Strategies” </div></div></div></div><div><div>The sixth paragraph in the section of the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” is deleted in its entirety. </div></div><div><div><div><div>Change in the Fund’s “Summary of Principal Risks” </div></div></div></div><div><div>The section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Summary of Principal Risks” is amended to delete “Treaty/Tax Risk” and add the following: </div></div><div><div><div>Tax Risk</div></div>.

The Fund invests in securities of Indian issuers. The Fund is subject to tax in India on the purchase and sale of Indian securities, which will reduce the Fund’s returns. For more information regarding the tax implications of investing in Indian securities, please see the section entitled “Indian Tax Disclosure.” </div><div><div><div>Criteria for Residence of Companies in India. </div></div></div><div>A foreign company will be considered a resident in India if its place of effective management (“POEM”) (defined as a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made) is in India in the relevant financial year. This test is to be applied taking the relevant financial year as a whole into consideration. However, the Fund expects that its place of effective management will be outside of India and, as a result, the Fund does not expect to be considered an Indian resident for tax purposes. </div><div><div><div>Indirect Transfers. </div></div></div><div>The Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) imposes Indian tax and withholding obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (“indirect transfers”). The share or interest of the foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity. The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, without reduction of liabilities, determined in accordance with Rule 11UB of the Income Tax Rule, 1962 (“IT Rules”). In cases where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in India. </div><div>If such gains are taxable in India then the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes. Because the Fund invests in Indian securities, the Fund may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets, and accordingly, shareholder redemptions and sales of Fund shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations. However, the IT Act provides for an </div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation><div> </div><hr/><ix:continuation continuedat="TextSelectionAppend_3844935_2"><ix:continuation continuedat="TextSelectionAppend_3844936_2"><div>exemption to shareholders in Category I Foreign Portfolio Investors (“FPI”), registered under SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019 (“2019 Regulations”) from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation. The Fund is a Category I FPI under the 2019 Regulations. Therefore, any redemptions or transfers by the Fund or the shareholders in the Fund should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax. </div><div>Further, the IT Act provides an exemption from the indirect transfer provisions for shareholders of the Fund who, at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer, neither hold the right of control or management in the Fund, nor hold voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in the Fund. </div><div><div><div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules. </div></div></div><div>The current legislation provides general anti-avoidance rules (“GAAR”) to curb aggressive tax planning through the use of sophisticated structures. GAAR became applicable with effect from April 1, 2017. The GAAR provides the Indian tax authorities a mechanism to deny any tax benefits in a transaction or any other arrangement that is believed to not have any commercial substance or purpose other than to obtain tax benefit(s) under a treaty. The provisions of GAAR will be applicable to arrangements (including a step in or a part thereof) entered into by a taxpayer, which may be declared as an “impermissible avoidance arrangement”. </div><div>As per the provisions of GAAR, an arrangement entered into by a taxpayer may be declared to be an impermissible avoidance arrangement, if the “main purpose” of the arrangement is to obtain a “tax benefit” and the arrangement: </div><div> </div>

Long-term capital gains (<div><div>i.e</div></div>., gains on the sale of shares held for more than 12 months) from the sale of equity shares of an Indian company listed on a recognized stock exchange are taxable in India at a rate of 10% provided any applicable STT has been paid, both on acquisition and sale of such shares (subject to certain transactions, to which the provisions of applicability and payment of STT upon acquisition do not apply). The tax on these capital gains is calculated on gains exceeding INR 100,000 (without any indexation and foreign exchange fluctuation benefits).
